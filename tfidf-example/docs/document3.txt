Defendants Appellants the Agency for International Development USAID the Department Health and Human Services HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC collectively the Agencies Defendants appeal from preliminary injunctions entered the United States District Court for the Southern District New York Marrero The district court enjoined the Agencies from enforcing provision the United States Leadership Against Tuberculosis and Malaria Act Leadership Act against Plaintiffs Appellees Alliance for Open Society International AOSI Pathfinder International Pathfinder Global Health Council GHC and InterAction These are organizations NGOs engaged the international fight against that receive funding under the the Leadership Act provides that funds made available carry out this Act may used provide assistance any group organization that does not have policy explicitly opposing prostitution This provision construed and implemented the Agencies requires NGOs condition receiving Leadership Act funds adopt policy explicitly opposing prostitution and prohibits recipients from engaging any activities that are inconsistent with stance Certain other recipients Leadership Act funds such the World Health Organization are not bound this explained below conclude that implemented the Agencies falls well beyond what the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld permissible conditions the receipt government funds Section does not merely require recipients Leadership Act funds refrain from certain conduct but goes substantially further and compels recipients espouse the government viewpoint See Consequently agree with the district court that Plaintiffs have demonstrated likelihood success the merits Finding abuse discretion the district court Leadership Congress passed the Leadership Act strengthen and enhance United States leadership and the effectiveness the United States response the tuberculosis and malaria pandemics Supp The Act designates several avenues through which this international campaign run including year global strategies the development vaccines and treatments and partnerships between federal agencies and NGOs which Congress recognized have proven effective combating the pandemic Act reflects Congress concern with the social cultural and behavioral causes See Section one congressional findings set forth addresses prostitution Prostitution and other sexual victimization are degrading women and children and should the policy the United States eradicate such practices The sex industry the trafficking individuals into such industry and sexual violence are additional causes and factors the spread the epidemic imposed two conditions Leadership Act funding First specified that funds made available carry out the Act may used promote advocate the legalization practice prostitution sex trafficking Second imposed Policy Requirement which specifies that funds made available carry out this Act may used provide assistance any group organization that does not have policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking except that this subsection shall not apply the Global Fund Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria the World Health Organization the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative any United Nations This litigation involves only the Policy Requirement Plaintiffs not challenge the Requirement sex trafficking Initial Implementation the Policy defendant Agencies implement the Leadership Act part funding NGOs involved the international fight against AOSI and Pathfinder are two such organizations AOSI runs program Central Asia that aims prevent the spread reducing injection drug use while Pathfinder works stem the spread providing family planning and reproductive health services more than twenty countries Both receive funding from sources other than the Agencies and neither supports prostitution But their work does involve engaging educating and assisting groups such prostitutes that are vulnerable well advocating approaches and discussing strategies for fighting among prostitutes among other places policy conferences and the Leadership Act was enacted the Department Justice Office Legal Counsel OLC warned that applying the Policy Requirement organizations would unconstitutional Heeding that warning Defendants initially refrained from enforcing against NGOs OLC subsequently changed course and withdrew what characterized its prior tentative advice asserting that there are reasonable arguments support the constitutionality applying the Policy Requirement organizations and starting mid the Agencies began applying the Requirement grantees Specifically USAID issued directive requiring that organizations condition receiving funding under the Act must have policy explicitly opposing prostitution Defendants also construed the Policy Requirement prohibiting grantees from engaging activities that were inconsistent with policy opposing prostitution effort remain eligible for Leadership Act funding both AOSI and Pathfinder adopted policy statements Pathfinder for example stated that opposes prostitution and sex trafficking because the harm they cause primarily women District Court First AOSI and Pathfinder sued the Agencies contending that conditioning Leadership Act funding the affirmative adoption policy opposing prostitution violated the First Amendment compelling grantees adopt and voice the government viewpoint prostitution and restricting grantees from engaging privately funded expression that the Agencies might deem insufficiently opposed prostitution They also asserted that the Policy Requirement was unconstitutionally vague with respect what sorts activity and expression were fact district court granted AOSI and Pathfinder preliminary injunctive relief Alliance for Open Agency for Alliance The court engaged thorough analysis the Supreme Court unconstitutional conditions jurisprudence focusing particular Regan Taxation With Representation FCC League Women Voters California and Rust Sullivan The court first concluded that because the Policy Requirement substantially impaired First Amendment protected activity conducted private entities with private funds condition receiving government benefit heightened scrutiny was warranted Alliance The court then concluded that the Policy Requirement applied AOSI and Pathfinder violated the First Amendment because was not narrowly tailored imposed restriction their use private funds without allowing for adequate alternative channels communication and compel led speech affirmatively requiring them adopt policy espousing the government preferred message Accordingly the court held that AOSI and Pathfinder had demonstrated likelihood success the merits and had met their burden showing irreparable harm The district court thus preliminarily enjoined Defendants from enforcing the Policy Requirement against AOSI Pathfinder and Defendants First the course the first appeal the Agencies informed that HHS and USAID were developing guidelines that would allow grantees establish work with separate affiliates that would not subject the Policy Requirement The Agencies were the view that the guidelines would satisfactorily address the relevant constitutional concerns accordance with our decision Brooklyn Legal Services Legal Services appropriate circumstances Congress may burden the First Amendment rights recipients government benefits the recipients are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression After the guidelines became effective remanded the case the district court determine the first instance whether interlocutory relief continued appropriate Alliance for Open Agency for Alliance Guidelines permit recipients Leadership Act funds partner with affiliate organizations that not comply with the Policy Requirement provided that the recipient and affiliate maintain adequate separation not threaten the integrity the Government programs and its message opposing prostitution HHS Guidance July USAID Acquisition Assistance Policy Directive AAPD Amendment July The Guidelines which discussed infra were slightly revised require recipients have objective integrity and independence from any affiliate that engages activities inconsistent with opposition the practice prostitution restricted activities Guidelines initially promulgated provided that recipient would deemed have objective integrity and independence adequate separation from affiliate the two entities are legally separate Leadership Act funds are transferred the affiliate used subsidize its restricted activities and the entities are physically and financially separate The Guidelines elaborated that whether sufficient physical and financial separation exists would determined and set forth five factors relevant that determination the existence separate personnel management and governance the existence separate accounts and records iii the degree separation between the recipient facilities and facilities used the affiliate conduct restricted activities the extent which signs and other forms identification distinguish the two entities and the extent which the government and the Leadership Act program are protected from public association with the affiliated organization and its restricted activities District Court Second remand AOSI and Pathfinder moved amend the complaint add Global Health Council and InterAction together the Associations plaintiffs and extend the preliminary injunction cover the Associations GHC alliance organizations dedicated international public health InterAction alliance international development and humanitarian NGOs Many the Associations members which include Pathfinder member both GHC and InterAction participate the international fight against receive Leadership Act funding are therefore subject the Policy Requirement and desire relief from These member organizations work includes administering health services and other programs that expressly target groups like prostitutes They also engage advocacy and discussion concerning controversial global health issues for example best practices for reducing among prostitutes policy forums and August the district court permitted GHC and InterAction join the litigation extended the preliminary injunction them and went consider whether interlocutory relief continued warranted light the Guidelines Alliance for Open Agency for Alliance The court held that was concluding that the Guidelines did not affect its previous determination that the Policy Requirement impermissibly compelled speech The court reasoned that hile the Guidelines may may not provide adequate alternate channel for Plaintiffs express their views regarding prostitution the clause requiring them espouse the government viewpoint remains intact also concluded that heightened scrutiny remained applicable because the Policy Requirement discriminates based viewpoint and that the Guidelines were too burdensome cure the Requirement constitutional defects Accordingly the court declined disturb its preliminary injunction Defendants appealed from both the and preliminary injunction Guidance Promulgated April while this appeal was pending HHS and USAID promulgated further guidance pertaining the Policy Requirement HHS formal regulation USAID policy directive HHS Organizational Integrity Entities That Are Implementing Programs and Activities Under the Leadership Act Apr codified USAID AAPD Amendment Apr The new guidance specifies that order comply with the Policy Requirement Leadership Act grantee must affirmatively state the funding document that opposed the practices prostitution and sex trafficking because the psychological and physical risks they pose for women men and children AAPD Amend and reaffirms that recipient can not engage activities that are inconsistent with its opposition prostitution Neither the nor the guidance offers recipients insight what activities may deemed inconsistent with opposition prostitution new guidance also modified the Guidelines for partnering with affiliate that does not comply with the Policy Requirement See For example under the revised Guidelines which profess allow more flexibility for funding recipients legal separation longer required but only one factor considered and separate management longer expressly identified relevant factor determining whether recipient has objective integrity and independence from affiliate The Agencies initially argue that Plaintiffs lack standing Plaintiffs bear the burden establishing standing Lujan Defenders Wildlife Because standing challenged here the basis the pleadings accept true all material allegations the

Plaintiffs have alleged constitutional and face actual imminent harm result the Policy Requirement They allege that the Requirement has compelled AOSI Pathfinder and many the Associations members

court determination that Plaintiffs are likely succeed the merits They not contest the district court finding irreparable harm conclude that Plaintiffs have demonstrated likelihood success the merits because the Policy Requirement likely violates the First Amendment impermissibly compelling Plaintiffs espouse the government viewpoint The Policy Requirement Likely Violates the First Spending Clause and Unconstitutional Conditions The Spending Clause the Constitution empowers Congress lay and collect Taxes Duties Imposts and Excises pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare the United States Const art This provision allows Congress condition the receipt federal moneys upon compliance the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives South Dakota Dole quoting Fullilove Klutznick well settled that Congress entitled further policy goals indirectly through its spending power that might not able achieve direct regulation See bjectives not thought within Article enumerated legislative fields may nevertheless attained through the use the spending power and the conditional grant federal funds internal quotation marks and citation omitted Congress power under the Spending Clause broad the constitutional limitations Congress when exercising its spending power are less exacting than those its authority regulate directly Defendants contend that because the Leadership Act Spending Clause enactment and Plaintiffs are free decline funding they not wish comply with its conditions the Policy Requirement should subjected only minimal scrutiny under Dole But Congress spending power while broad not unlimited and other constitutional provisions may provide independent bar the conditional grant federal funds Pursuant this unconstitutional conditions doctrine has come known the government may not place condition the receipt benefit subsidy that infringes upon the recipient constitutionally protected rights even the government has obligation offer the benefit the first instance See Perry Sindermann ven though person has right valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number reasons there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely may not deny benefit person basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests especially his interest freedom speech the Supreme Court recently reiterated the government may not deny benefit person basis that infringes his constitutionally protected freedom speech even has entitlement that benefit Rumsfeld Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights FAIR internal quotation marks omitted tension between the breadth Congress spending power one hand and the principle that condition the receipt federal funds may not infringe upon the recipient First Amendment rights the other has given rise three seminal Supreme Court decisions and several related cases from our Circuit The Supreme Court cases are Regan Taxation With Representation FCC League Women Voters California and Rust Sullivan Our cases include series decisions concerning conditions imposed upon recipients funding from the Legal Services Corporation LSC Velazquez Legal Services Velazquez Legal Services Velazquez Velazquez and Brooklyn Legal Services Legal Services BLS Regan plaintiff Taxation With Representation TWR nonprofit lobbying corporation challenged statute that denied tax deductions organizations that engaged substantial lobbying see TWR argued that the prohibition against substantial lobbying organizations imposed unconstitutional condition the receipt contributions The Supreme Court disagreed concluding that TWR remained free receive deductible contributions support its nonlobbying activity and could create separate affiliate under pursue its lobbying activity Given that alternative the Court concluded that Congress not infringed any First Amendment rights regulated any First Amendment activity but simply chosen not pay for TWR lobbying concurring opinion Justice Blackmun emphasized the saving effect stating his view that alone would constitutional defect ive but that organization right speak not infringed because free lobby through its affiliate without losing tax benefits for its nonlobbying activities Blackmun concurring following term the Supreme Court decided League Women Voters which involved First Amendment challenge provision the Public Broadcasting Act that prohibited stations receiving federal funds from editorializing The Court struck down the provision troubled the fact that barred grantee from using even wholly private funds finance its editorial activity stating that unlike the situation faced TWR station that receives only its overall income from federal grants barred absolutely from all editorializing The Court noted however that recipients were permitted establish affiliate organizations which could then use the station facilities editorialize with nonfederal funds such statutory mechanism would plainly valid under the reasoning Regan the recipient would free the same way that TWR was free make known its views matters public importance through its nonfederally funded editorializing affiliate without losing federal grants for its noneditorializing broadcast activities Supreme Court elaborated these themes Rust which involved facial challenge HHS regulations implementing Title the Public Health Service Act Title authorizes HHS make grants organizations help them run family planning projects but provides that Title funds shall used programs where abortion method family planning quoting The HHS regulations prohibited Title projects from providing abortion counseling referrals engaging any activities that encourage promote advocate abortion method family planning However the regulations allowed grantees engage activities long their Title projects maintained objective integrity and independence from such activities determination made HHS based factors such the existence separate personnel and the degree separation between the Title project and facilities used for restricted activities quoting The Rust plaintiffs argued that the regulations violated the First Amendment because they discriminat based viewpoint prohibit ing all discussion about abortion lawful option and because they conditioned the receipt Title funds relinquishing the right engage speech internal quotation marks omitted Supreme Court disagreed concluding that the Government has not discriminated the basis viewpoint has merely chosen fund one activity the exclusion the other The Government can without violating the Constitution selectively fund program encourage certain activities believes the public interest without the same time funding alternative program which seeks deal with the problem another way held that the regulations not force the Title grantee give speech but merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from Title activities The Court emphasized that this was unlike the funding condition found unconstitutional League Women Voters where the Government placed the condition the recipient the subsidy rather than particular program service emphasis original turn now three decisions this Court arising under the Legal Services Corporation Act pursuant which the LSC makes grants local organizations that provide free legal assistance indigent clients Velazquez Congress passed legislation barring LSC grants entities that engage certain activities such lobbying class actions thereby restrict ing grantees use and federal funds alike order cure the constitutional infirmities the restrictions LSC issued program integrity regulations modeled after those upheld Rust allowing grantees affiliate with organizations that did engage prohibited activities long the entities maintained adequate physical and financial separation Velazquez considered facial challenge the statute and LSC regulations which the plaintiffs argued impermissibly burden grantees exercise First Amendment activities and constitut restriction expression Judge Leval writing for the majority synthesized Regan League Women Voters and Rust establishing that appropriate circumstances Congress may burden the First Amendment rights recipients government benefits the recipients are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression The facial challenge therefore failed because although the affiliate option might applied some LSC grantees prove unduly burdensome there was reason think this would true for all grantees However one provision the statute which prohibited grantees from representing clients challenging existing welfare law was held invalid impermissible viewpoint discrimination Supreme Court affirmed our invalidation that restriction Velazquez The Court interpreted Rust having implicitly reli the rationale that the counseling activities the doctors under Title amounted governmental speech explaining that funding decisions can sustained instances which the government itself the speaker instances like Rust which the government use private speakers transmit information pertaining its own program internal quotation marks and citation omitted The Velazquez Court held however that the LSC program unlike Title was not designed promote governmental message lawyer not the government speaker but rather speaks the behalf his her private indigent client Therefore Rust did not save the restriction seeking welfare reform The Court declined review the portion Velazquez that had upheld the LSC program integrity regulations Mem denying certiorari Velazquez the Velazquez plaintiffs brought challenge the LSC regulations BLS The district court enjoined application the regulations reasoning that they imposed undue burden the plaintiffs First Amendment rights LSC interest program integrity could fulfilled means less restrictive appeal held that the district court application undue test the regulations was error reiterating the standard articulated Velazquez that grantees First Amendment rights may burdened they are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression therefore remanded for the district court evaluate the program integrity regulations under that The Policy Requirement Warrants Heightened Applying these cases the one before conclude that the Policy Requirement implemented the Agencies falls well beyond what the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld permissible funding conditions Unlike the funding conditions the cases discussed above the Policy Requirement does not merely restrict recipients from engaging certain expression such lobbying Regan editorializing League Women Voters speech Rust welfare reform litigation the LSC cases but pushes considerably further and mandates that recipients affirmatively say something that they are opposed the practice prostitution The Policy Requirement and compels recipients condition funding espouse the government Compelling speech condition receiving government benefit can not squared with the First Amendment See Wooley Maynard finding unconstitutional requirement that drivers condition using the roads display state motto Live Free Die license plates Speiser Randall finding unconstitutional requirement that veterans condition receiving property tax exemption declare that they not advocate the forcible overthrow government State Educ Barnette finding unconstitutional requirement that schoolchildren condition going school salute the flag stating that such involuntary affirmation could commanded only even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence much Wooley Speiser and Barnette silence neutrality not option for Plaintiffs order avoid losing Leadership Act funding they must declare their opposition prostitution Defendants correctly point out these traditional compelled speech cases involved public benefits not government funding programs and are therefore distinguishable that respect But these cases teach that where here the government seeks affirmatively require speech its efforts raise serious First Amendment The Supreme Court recently implied much FAIR where upheld the Solomon Amendment requirement that universities permit military recruiters campus condition receiving federal funding The Court noted that here nothing this case approaching pledge motto that the school must endorse The Policy Requirement calls for exactly The Policy Requirement also because requires recipients take the government side particular issue well established that intrusions free speech offend the First Amendment See Rosenberger Rector Visitors the Univ axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based its substantive content the message conveys Simon Schuster Members the State Crime Victims stating broad principle that egulations which permit the Government discriminate the basis the content the message can not tolerated under the First Amendment internal quotation marks omitted funding conditions that target speech are not necessarily unconstitutional see Rust such conditions are constitutionally troublesome Regan for example the Court applied minimal scrutiny reviewing condition that was unlike the Policy Requirement decidedly banned all lobbying organizations regardless the nature the legislation the organization position See League Women Voters which invalidated restriction editorializing all four dissenting Justices indicated that the restriction were they too would find constitutionally problematic See Rehnquist dissenting emphasizing that condition was strictly neutral not directed editorial views one particular ideological bent Stevens dissenting greatest significance for the statutory restriction completely neutral its operation prohibits all editorials without any distinction being drawn concerning the point view that might expressed Rosenberger When the government targets not subject matter but particular views taken speakers subject the violation the First Amendment all the more blatant LSC cases confirm this conclusion Velazquez invalidated restriction prohibiting LSC grantees from representing clients seeking welfare reform The Supreme Court affirmed concluding that Rust could not justify the restriction because although Rust had implicitly established funding decisions can sustained instances which the government use private speakers transmit information pertaining its own program the LSC grantees were not speaking behalf the government Velazquez internal quotation marks omitted Finally BLS while remanded for the district court apply the adequate alternative channels test the LSC program integrity regulations expressly recognized citing Velazquez that substantive restrictions that are directed toward speech such might require closer attention issue that went the statutory restrictions challenged the LSC cases See BLS The Policy Requirement substantive and directed toward speech affirmatively requires recipients speak this bold combination funding condition restriction that both affirmative and quintessentially that warrants heightened the targeted speech concerning prostitution the context the international effort subject international debate The right communicate freely such matters public concern lies the heart the First Amendment See NAACP Claiborne Hardware xpression public issues has always rested the highest rung the hierarchy First Amendment values internal quotation marks omitted The Policy Requirement offends that principle mandating that Plaintiffs affirmatively espouse the government position contested public issue where the differences are both real and substantive For example the World Health Organization WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme UNAIDS have recognized advocating for the reduction penalties for prostitution prevent such penalties from interfering with outreach efforts among the best practices for Plaintiffs claim that being forced declare their opposition prostitution harms their credibility and integrity NGOs which generally avoid taking controversial policy positions likely offend host nations and partner organizations and risks offending all the groups whose approach may differ from that the government not mention some the very people prostitutes whose trust they must earn stop the spread Appellees Rust and the Government Speech defending the Policy Requirement speech mandate the Agencies turn Rust which upheld prohibition abortion counseling Since Rust the Supreme Court has explained that decision having implicitly relied upon government speech principle stating that funding decisions can sustained instances which the government itself the speaker instances like Rust which the government use private speakers transmit information pertaining its own program Velazquez internal quotation marks and citation omitted This because when the government appropriates public funds promote particular policy its own entitled say what wishes Rosenberger have permitted the government regulate the content what not expressed when the speaker when enlists private entities convey its own message Therefore hen the government disburses public funds private entities convey governmental message may take legitimate and appropriate steps ensure that its message neither garbled nor distorted the grantee According the Agencies this case like Rust case because enacting the Leadership Act Congress sought advance the greatest extent possible its message opposing prostitution chose enlist the recipients Leadership Act funding disseminate its message and ensure that the message was conveyed effectively required that those recipients have policy Appellants see DKT Agency for upholding Policy Requirement are not Policy Requirement goes well beyond the funding condition upheld Rust because compels Plaintiffs voice the government viewpoint and were their own Indeed the Rust Court expressly observed that othing the challenged regulations requires doctor represent his own any opinion that does not fact hold emphasis added Rather the grantee staff could remain silen with regard abortion and asked about abortion was free make clear that advice regarding abortion simply beyond the scope the program Here the other hand Plaintiffs not have the option remaining silent neutral Instead they must represent their own opinion that they affirmatively oppose prostitution that they might not categorically hold Suffice say that Rust would have been very different case had the government gone far requiring Title recipients affirmatively adopt policy statement opposing abortion the way the Leadership Act mandates the adoption policy statement opposing prostitution The government has compelling NGOs affirmatively pledge their opposition prostitution stepped beyond what might have been appropriate ensure that its message would not garbled distorted Rosenberger not mean imply that the government may never require affirmative speech condition participating federal program use example supplied Defendants the government were fund campaign urging children Just Say drugs not doubt that could require grantees state that they oppose drug use children But that scenario the government program effect its message That not here The stated purpose the Leadership Act fight well tuberculosis and Defendants can not now recast the Leadership Act global program messaging campaign Velazquez Congress can not recast condition funding mere definition its program every case lest the First Amendment reduced simple semantic exercise the principle allowed Congress compel funding recipients affirmatively espouse its viewpoint every subsidiary issue subsumed within federal spending program the exception would swallow the Defendants assert that advocating against prostitution indeed central the Leadership Act program Appellants but difficult reconcile that assertion with what the Act does have seen the Policy Requirement expressly exempts three organizations and all agencies from having comply with his subsection shall not apply the Global Fund Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria the World Health Organization the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative any United Nations agency previously noted the WHO and UNAIDS have taken public position odds with the Policy Requirement recognizing the reduction penalties for prostitution best practice the fight against Defendants attempt distinguish these exempted recipients the ground that they are public international organizations such that forcing them adopt policy would require multilateral negotiations Appellants But advocacy were central the government program could course simply choose not fund these organizations short the Agencies suggestion that requiring Plaintiffs adopt policy statement integral the Leadership Act program undermined the fact that the government has chosen fund global organizations that remain free express and indeed openly express contrary policy policy Nor are persuaded the Agencies argument that the Policy Requirement entitled leeway because implicates foreign affairs Appellants While mindful the government strong interest managing international relations agree with the district court that this interest this case does not warrant the deference that the Agencies request See Alliance The Agencies reliance DKT Memorial Fund Agency for International Development misplaced that case centered around restriction the First Amendment activities foreign NGOs receiving government funds The challenge here the impact the Policy Requirement domestic NGOs Indeed the Agencies have applied the Policy Requirement foreign organizations since its inception without challenge This litigation arose only after the government reversed course and began also applying the Requirement organizations like AOSI and Pathfinder The Policy Requirement compels domestic NGOs adopt policy statement particular issue and prohibits them from engaging certain expression for example conferences and forums throughout the United States These factors convince that the speech far more domestic than foreign The Finally the Agencies contend that any type problems the Policy Requirement are successfully addressed the Guidelines because any entity unwilling state its opposition prostitution can form affiliate that does consequence the Agencies assert the parent organization not compelled speak any message all But this assertion fails confront the fact that whether the recipient parent affiliate required affirmatively speak the government viewpoint prostitution The adequate alternative channels for protected expression test which predicated the rationale that limitations speech are permissible grantees can express their opinions elsewhere does not provide the proper framework for evaluating the Policy Requirement speech mandate The curative function adequate alternative channel alleviate the burden constraint speech providing outlet that allows organization engage through the use affiliate the privately funded expression that otherwise would have been impermissibly prohibited the federal program For example Regan organization ability form affiliate freed engage privately funded lobbying and League Women Voters the funding restriction would have been saved the recipient stations had been allowed form affiliates engage privately funded editorializing simply does not make sense conceive the Guidelines here somehow addressing the Policy Requirement affirmative speech requirement affording outlet engage privately funded silence other words providing outlet nothing all may very well that the Guidelines afford Plaintiffs adequate outlet for expressing their opinions prostitution but there remains top that the additional affirmative requirement that the recipient entity pledge its opposition prostitution the district court aptly stated hile the Guidelines may may not provide adequate alternate channel for Plaintiffs express their views regarding prostitution the clause requiring Plaintiffs adopt the Government view regarding prostitution remains intact Alliance The Guidelines their very nature not account for that the reasons set forth above conclude that Plaintiffs have demonstrated likelihood success the merits their First Amendment challenge Because the Policy Requirement compels grantees espouse the government position controversial issue the district court did not abuse its discretion preliminarily enjoining its enforcement pending trial the district court grant preliminary injunctive relief majority today holds that the Policy Requirement falls well beyond what the Supreme Court and this Court have upheld permissible conditions the receipt government funds the contrary the Policy Requirement together with the Guidelines implemented Defendants precisely line with the unconstitutional conditions doctrine has been applied the context subsidy conditions alleged violate the First Amendment The Policy Requirement neither imposes coercive penalty protected First Amendment rights nor discriminates way aimed the suppression any ideas Furthermore the nature the Policy Requirement entirely proper because the Leadership Act does not implicate principles but rather allows the government subsidize the transmittal message has concluded part its preferred method fighting Therefore heightened scrutiny not proper this case Because the Policy Requirement entirely rational exercise Congress powers pursuant the Spending Clause and because Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely succeed the merits their claim that the Policy Requirement unconstitutional would vacate the District Court grant preliminary injunction Accordingly respectfully further explanation the Leadership Act may helpful understanding the purpose the funding restriction issue here Congress enacted the United States Leadership Against Tuberculosis and Malaria Act Stat codified amended The Act was reauthorized and amended See Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act Stat codified The current version the Act directs the President establish comprehensive integrated year

risks procuring sex commercially and working eliminate the sexual exploitation women and children Congress imposed two conditions Leadership Act funds that are relevant this case First Congress

have policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking except that this subsection shall not apply the Global Fund Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria the World Health Organization the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative any United Nations Policy Requirement this way Congress ensured not only that Leadership Act funds would used promote prostitution but also that its funds only organizations that share the Act disapproval prostitution and sex trafficking DKT Agency for the United States Department Health and Human Services HHS and the United States Agency for International Development USAID Agencies implemented the Policy Requirement promulgating certain regulations and directives The current rules require that Leadership Act recipients agree public announcements the

case are grounded two substantive restrictions government conduct imposed the First Amendment the prohibition against compelled speech and the prohibition against viewpoint discrimination Because the Policy Requirement not direct restriction speech but rather only condition the receipt federal subsidy analyze Plaintiffs First Amendment challenges through the prism the unconstitutional conditions

has struck down government attempts directly compel school children recite the Pledge Allegiance pain expulsion from public school see compel drivers bear state motto their license plates pain

Taxation With Representation Regan emphasis added Supreme Court opinion Speiser noting that the denial tax exemption may infringe speech unconstitutional conditions doctrine was applied the context First Amendment challenge the denial government benefit Speiser that case the State California attempted require veterans otherwise eligible for property tax exemption sign loyalty oath stating that they did not advocate the violent overthrow the government The Supreme Court first observed that settled that speech can effectively limited the exercise the taxing power deny exemption claimants who engage certain forms speech effect penalize them for such speech Its deterrent effect the same the State were fine them for this speech Speiser citation omitted Therefore the Court concluded that the fact that tax exemption privilege bounty does not mean that its denial may not infringe speech The Court explained that Speiser the denial tax exemption for engaging certain speech necessarily will have the effect coercing the claimants refrain from the proscribed speech The denial frankly aimed the suppression dangerous ideas quoting Douds Having characterized the condition tantamount fine the Court struck down pursuant the Due Process Clause the Fourteenth Amendment for lacking sufficient procedural protections Taxation With Representation the Supreme Court was called apply Speiser the context condition nonprofit groups ability retain status Specifically the Court addressed whether Congress prohibition lobbying nonprofit organizations that were allowed receive contributions amounted unconstitutional condition the organizations ability receive money See Taxation With Representation While lobbying clearly protected the First Amendment see Presidents Conference Noerr Motor Freight the Court disagreed with the argument that the government had violated nonprofit groups First Amendment rights declining pay for the lobbying out public monies Taxation With Representation The Court reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized the State quoting Cammarano United States Douglas concurring The Court reasoned that the condition was valid because Congress did not deny plaintiff Taxation With Representation TWR the right receive deductible contributions support its activity nor does deny TWR any independent benefit account its intention lobby Congress had not denied TWR the right receive contributions support activities because despite Congress restriction the law allowed TWR use dual structure whereby TWR could continue receive contributions conduct activities while affiliate organization could conduct any lobbying activities with funds The Supreme Court explained that therefore Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights regulated any First Amendment activity Congress has simply chosen not pay for TWR lobbying Supreme Court also rejected the claim that Congress had violated TWR

Supreme Court explained that not the law that strict scrutiny applies whenever Congress subsidizes some speech but not all speech Rather appropriations are comparable tax exemptions and deductions

Marshall pointed out that Congress had reality not merely den ied subsidy for lobbying activities the Court had suggested had prohibited organization from receiving contributions for all its activities whenever one those activities substantial lobbying Blackmun concurring Justice Blackmun therefore urged that this restriction would fact den significant benefit organizations choosing exercise their constitutional rights and result would unconstitutional condition support for this conclusion Justice Blackmun cited among other opinions Justice Douglas concurrence Cammarano which noted that while Congress denial deduction for lobbying activities was constitutional the denial all business deductions for taxpayer who lobbied would placing penalty the exercise First Amendment rights Cammarano Douglas concurring cited Taxation With Representation Blackmun concurring Justice Blackmun Taxation With Representation concurrence went explain that the lobbying restriction that case was saved the fact that nonprofit organization could create affiliate make known its views legislation without losing tax benefits for its nonlobbying activities Taxation With Representation Because this dual structure Justice Blackmun explained that the Court finds that Congress purpose imposing the lobbying restriction was merely ensure that contributions are used pay for substantial lobbying With Representation therefore expanded two ways Speiser initial discussion the unconstitutional conditions doctrine applies conditions government benefits subsidies that affect First Amendment rights First the Court noted that funding condition would unconstitutional operated coercive penalty the exercise First Amendment rights The Court suggested two ways that government condition could this restricted recipient First Amendment speech outside the scope the recipient participation the government program for example restricting TWR from lobbying even with contributions denied government benefits which the recipient would otherwise entitled and that are independent from those provided the government program issue for example denying property tax exemption for failure take loyalty oath See Second Taxation With Representation cautioned that when the purpose condition not define the boundaries federal spending but rather suppress certain viewpoints the condition may unconstitutional See either coercive penalty viewpoint suppression then that the denial government benefit may infringe person constitutionally protected freedom speech even has entitlement that benefit FAIR internal quotation marks omitted the following two sections first address cases analyzing funding conditions penalties speech and then turn cases discussing funding conditions alleged impermissibly discriminate the basis term following its Taxation With Representation decision the Supreme Court decided FCC League Women Voters which underlined the importance the affiliate structure available Taxation With Representation League Women Voters the Supreme Court ruled that Congress prohibition editorializing any noncommercial broadcast station that received federal grant was not sufficiently limited justify the substantial abridgment important journalistic freedoms which the First Amendment jealously protects denying federal grants stations that editorialized Congress had not merely refused subsidize editorializing public broadcasting stations but rather had caused station that receives only its overall income from federal grants barred absolutely from all editorializing The station way limiting the use its federal funds all noneditorializing activities and more importantly barred from using even wholly private funds finance its editorial activity The Court explicitly noted however that Congress maintained the restriction but allowed broadcast stations establish affiliate organizations editorialize with nonfederal money such statutory mechanism would plainly valid under the reasoning Taxation With Representation The Court League Women Voters therefore both the Taxation With Representation Court and Justice Blackmun concurring that case had suggested concluded that federal funding condition that not only limited the scope the government program but that also denied recipient the right spend private money support protected First Amendment activities went too

conditioned the grants with the restriction that none the federal funds were used programs where abortion method family planning quoting The Supreme Court upheld agency regulations preventing federally funded projects from providing abortion counseling engaging activities that encourage promote advocate abortion method family planning quoting The Court ruled that the regulations did not force the grantee give speech they merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from activities When the government simply insist that public funds spent for the purposes for which they were authorized the overnment not denying benefit anyone and there unconstitutional penalty free speech The Court noted that the regulations Rust continued allow healthcare organizations advocate for abortion they simply were required conduct those activities through programs that were separate and independent from the project that receives federal funds this way the regulations Rust were like those Taxation With Representation that allowed for protected lobbying continue with contributions and unlike those League Women Voters that prohibited stations from editorializing even with private funds See The Rust Court explained requiring that the federal program grantee engage activity separately from activity receiving federal funding Congress has consistent with our teachings League Women Voters and Taxation With Representation not denied the right engage activities Congress has merely refused fund such activities out the public fisc and the Secretary has simply required certain degree separation from the federally funded project order ensure the integrity the federally funded see also Velazquez Legal Servs hereinafter Velazquez

plurality opinion rejected the argument that the law imposed unconstitutional condition the receipt federal funding because penaliz library for failing install filtering software every one its computers quoting Stevens dissenting The plurality explained that the not penalize libraries that choose not install such software deny them the right provide their patrons with unfiltered Internet access Rather the law simply reflects Congress decision not subsidize their doing the extent that libraries wish offer unfiltered access they are free without federal assistance refusal fund protected activity without more can not equated with the imposition penalty that some internal quotation marks omitted The plurality also expressly distinguished cases that involved true penalties such denial promotion outright discharge from employment from nonsubsidies like the one issue American Library this way American Library was precisely line with Speiser Taxation With Representation League Women Voters and Rust When acting pursuant its Spending Clause powers Congress may attach conditions federal subsidies that have the effect limiting recipients First Amendment rights long the conditions not limit free speech outside the scope the government program and not deny independent benefits which recipients are otherwise entitled attempt penalize First Amendment activity Even when funding conditions limit affect speech such limits are generally permissible they are meant only ensure that government funds are used for the purposes for which they were authorized This because absent special circumstances there coercive force behind funding condition that truly cabined the federal subsidy program which attached potential recipients not wish abide the condition they can simply choose not accept the funds See Library the extent that libraries wish offer unfiltered access they are free without federal assistance Rust his limitation consequence their decision accept employment

and therefore are not the equivalent direct restrictions true penalties Library See Brooklyn Legal Velazquez and Taxation With Representation also emphasize that funding conditions may unconstitutional they discriminate invidiously such way aim the suppression dangerous ideas Regan Taxation With Representation quoting Cammarano The Supreme Court and this Court have addressed claims that funding conditions impermissibly discriminate the basis viewpoint Rust Rosenberger Finley the Velazquez cases and American Library Rust recipients the family planning grants argued that the regulations restricting federal funds from being used for abortion services constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination favor position Relying Taxation With Representation they argued that because the government continue fund speech ancillary pregnancy testing manner that not evenhanded with respect views and information about abortion invidiously discriminates the basis viewpoint internal quotation marks omitted The Supreme Court rejected this challenge and found that Congress had not discriminated favor position but had merely chosen fund one activity the exclusion the other The Court reiterated that here basic difference between direct state interference with protected activity and state encouragement alternative activity consonant with legislative policy quoting Maher Roe other words Rust was not case the Government suppressing dangerous idea but prohibition project grantee its employees from engaging activities outside the project scope This was even though can not denied that the scope the project Rust necessarily limited recipients ability advocate viewpoint within the scope the government Court applied Rust the context the provision funds student groups Rosenberger Rector Visitors University Virginia that case the University Virginia denied funding from its Student Activities Fund student organization that wished publish newspaper that advocated Christian viewpoints The Supreme Court analogized the Student Activities Fund creating metaphysical limited public forum for student speech The Court explained that once the State has opened limited forum the State must respect the lawful boundaries has itself set The State may not exclude speech where its distinction not reasonable light the purpose served the forum nor may discriminate against speech the basis its viewpoint internal citations and quotation marks omitted The Supreme Court rejected the University attempt rely Rust for the proposition that could make funding decisions when necessary accomplish its educational mission doing the Court acknowledged that was true that have permitted the government regulate the content what not expressed when the speaker when enlists private entities convey its own message The Court pointed Rust case government did not create program encourage private speech but instead used private speakers transmit specific information pertaining its own program recognized that when the government appropriates public funds promote particular policy its own entitled say what wishes When the government disburses public funds private entities convey governmental message may take legitimate and appropriate steps ensure that its message neither garbled nor distorted the internal citations omitted The Court explained however that had never held that restrictions are proper when the University does not itself speak subsidize transmittal message favors but instead expends funds encourage diversity views from private speakers sum because the University offered funds student groups specifically encourage diversity views from private speakers and intended facilitate the speech private speakers who convey their own messages the University could not having created public forum for student speech then silence the expression selected viewpoints Court had opportunity further explain Rosenberger National Endowment for the Arts Finley that case Congress directed the National Endowment for the Arts NEA consider general standards decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values the American public determining whether award federal grants artists Performance artists who were denied funding claimed that the funding condition constituted viewpoint discrimination against art that offended standards decency did not respect mainstream values The Supreme Court rejected this challenge and concluded that Congress restriction would not give rise the suppression protected expression doing the Supreme Court distinguished the nature the program issue Finley with that Rosenberger The Supreme Court explained that Rosenberger the government indiscriminately encourage diversity views from private speakers quoting Rosenberger Finley the other hand the NEA was mandated make esthetic judgments that were inherently The purpose the program therefore set the NEA subsidy apart from the subsidy issue Rosenberger which was available all student organizations and from comparably objective decisions allocating public benefits such access school auditorium municipal theater the second class mailing privileges available all newspapers and other periodical publications issue other cases where viewpoint discrimination was found impermissible internal citations and quotation marks omitted The Supreme Court reiterated its warning that nevertheless the government may not leverage its power award subsidies the basis subjective criteria into penalty disfavored viewpoints and may not aim the suppression dangerous ideas Having found evidence such suppression however the logic Rust Sullivan applied The government was free allocate competitive funding according criteria that would impermissible were direct regulation speech criminal penalty stake relying part Rust accord Brooklyn Legal government may allocate competitive funding according criteria that would impermissible were direct regulation speech stake Court was called apply these cases Velazquez that case lawyers employed grantees the Legal Services Corporation LSC challenged law that barred LSC funds from being used perform various activities including lobbying participating class actions seeking attorneys fees seeking reform challenge existing welfare laws first analyzed Taxation With Representation FCC League Women Voters and Rust and summarized those cases providing that appropriate circumstances Congress may burden the First Amendment rights recipients government benefits the recipients are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression Velazquez upheld all the restrictions issue from facial challenge that they burdened the recipients ability use private funds engage First Amendment protected activity relied the teaching Taxation With Representation and League Women Voters and the fact that Rust consistent with these cases that subsidy restrictions are acceptable there are adequate alternative avenues for expression through affiliates left for future case ultimately Brooklyn Legal Services the question whether the alternatives provided under the LSC program were fact adequate the context challenge See infra Velazquez also upheld almost all the restrictions against viewpoint discrimination challenge because found that they were fact viewpoint neutral However concluded that the limitation that precluded lawyer who received LSC funds from challenging existing welfare rule suit behalf client for welfare benefits was not viewpoint neutral noted that the restriction clearly seeks discourage challenges the status quo The majority declined follow Jacobs view concurring part and dissenting part that whether viewpoint discrimination was permissible the context the proviso issue turned whether the government through funding the LSC sought promote diversity private views had done Rosenberger See Jacobs concurring part dissenting part arguing additionally that the proviso was viewpoint neutral Judge Jacobs concluded that the LSC program was not created fund diversity private views and that when the government does not create limited public forum for the expression diverse viewpoints the principle explicitly announced Rust and not implicated the facts Rosenberger applies hen the government funds specific services deems the public interest may require grantees get with its program The majority the other hand reasoned that Rust conclusion that the government that case had not discriminated the basis viewpoint has merely chosen fund one activity the exclusion the other Rust could not reliably taken face value Velazquez Instead adopting Judge Jacobs framework the majority focused the type speech issue noting that criticism government policy garners the strongest First Amendment protection Because the majority found that lawyer argument that welfare statute invalid was closer criticism official policy than the type speech issue cases where the Supreme Court had rejected viewpoint discrimination challenges abortion counseling Rust and indecent art Finley held that the restriction challenging welfare laws was subject strict First Amendment scrutiny certiorari Legal Services Velazquez hereinafter Velazquez the Supreme Court appeared generally endorse Judge Jacobs framework for comparing the LSC restrictions with the restrictions issue Rust and Rosenberger although disagreed with Judge Jacobs conclusion that the LSC program was more like the former than the latter The Supreme Court explained that while the Rust Court did not place explicit reliance the rationale that counseling services the doctors under Title amounted governmental speech have explained Rust this understanding Velazquez The Court therefore noted that funding decisions can sustained instances which the government itself the speaker instances like Rust which the government used private speakers transmit specific information pertaining its own program Velazquez internal citation omitted quoting Rosenberger The Court contrasted those cases with situation which the government does not itself speak subsidize transmittal message favors but instead expends funds encourage diversity views from private speakers quoting Rosenberger the latter case does not follow that restrictions are proper quoting Rosenberger omission Velazquez The Court acknowledged that the LSC program was different from the Student Activities Fund issue Rosenberger because the LSC program did not seek encourage diversity views but concluded that the salient point that like the program Rosenberger the LSC program was designed facilitate private speech not promote governmental message The private nature the speech facilitated was underlined the fact that the government sought use existing medium expression the lawyer client relationship and control class cases ways which distort its usual functioning Velazquez Court also rejected the government argument that the restriction suits challenging welfare laws was necessary define the scope and contours the federal program and help the current welfare system function more efficient and fair manner removing from the program complex challenges existing welfare laws The Court ruled that Congress can not recast condition funding mere definition its program every case lest the First Amendment reduced simple semantic exercise The Court explained that the context this statute there programmatic message the kind recognized Rust and which sufficed there allow the Government specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives ultimately holding the restriction invalid the Court emphasized that here private speech involved even Congress antecedent funding decision can not aimed the suppression ideas thought inimical the Government own interest citing Regan Taxation With Representation and Speiser Randall United States American Library plurality the Court explicitly rejected the argument that Velazquez limited Rust cases which the government seeks communicate specific message quoting Stevens dissenting Dissenting Justice Stevens relied Velazquez argue that the condition requiring public libraries install filtering software was attempt distort medium computers Justice Stevens rejected the American Library plurality assertion that Rust allowed Congress restrict the scope its own subsidy programs arguing that Rust only involved and only applies instances governmental speech that situations which the government seeks communicate specific message The plurality however explained that Velazquez held only that restrictions are improper when the government does not itself speak subsidize transmittal message favors but instead expends funds encourage diversity views from private speakers quoting Velazquez emphasis added American Library The plurality reasoned that Velazquez did not apply American Library because public libraries not install Internet terminals provide forum for Web publishers express themselves but rather provide patrons with online material requisite and appropriate quality this case the majority concludes that the Policy Requirement warrants heightened scrutiny because bold combination funding condition restriction that both affirmative and quintessentially However the Policy Requirement permissible funding condition under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine has been applied the government subsidy context because neither imposes penalty protected First Amendment rights nor discriminates way aimed the suppression ideas Furthermore the nature the Policy Requirement entirely proper because public forum principles are implicated this obvious must noted the outset that the Policy Requirement does not actually compel anyone speak the government favored viewpoint The Policy Requirement condition the voluntary receipt Leadership Act funds funds which are available only groups that wish participate the government global strateg combat The Supreme Court has explained that here basic difference between direct state interference with protected activity and state encouragement alternative activity

effect free speech the direct regulation speech See Speiser The unconstitutional conditions doctrine provides the framework for analyzing when the denial government benefit rises the level infringement free speech Despite engaging thorough discussion unconstitutional conditions cases the government subsidy context the majority puts that doctrine aside and appears conclude that when funding condition imposes affirmative rather than negative speech requirement always raise serious First Amendment concerns support for this proposition the majority offers two pieces evidence First the majority observes that West Virginia State Board Education Barnette Speiser and Wooley Maynard were compelled speech cases where heightened scrutiny was applied where the restrictions issue were otherwise struck down Second the majority points one sentence FAIR that believes suggests that funding conditions push beyond what the First Amendment the majority recognizes Barnette Speiser and Wooley are not cases where the government sought appropriate public funds and then limit the scope the subsidy program Wooley and Barnette have traditionally been described cases the government attempt compel speech through the direct force law See Johanns Livestock Mktg describing Barnette case outright compulsion speech While those cases can creatively recast the majority does along with Speiser cases about conditions placed the governmental benefits going school Barnette and using the roads Wooley the government attempt deny the benefits those cases was quite different from the Policy Requirement issue here Barnette and Wooley the only alternatives accepting the government benefits would not public school not drive the public roads respectively The government therefore used its monopoly power over public education and the public roads put recipients choice that was obviously coercive there was realistic alternative accepting the conditions and giving First Amendment rights See Frost explaining that the choice whether use the public highways submit burden constitutional rights gave the plaintiff choice except choice between the rock and the whirlpool this case Plaintiffs not argue that Leadership Act funds are vital their continued survival even that they are the only source funds fight Endowment for the Arts Finley Scalia concurring the judgment viewing skeptically the potential argument that the denial entirely voluntary subsidy may constitute coercion equivalent direct compulsion speak were the only source recipient funding Moreover Barnette Speiser and Wooley the threatened denial government benefit turned requiring the recipient speak message that was unrelated the government benefit issue The government those cases threatened the denial existing benefit going school property tax exemption and using the roads respectively means coercing recipients give First Amendment rights The restrictions Barnette Speiser and Wooley were not merely attempts confine government spending the scope subsidy program course because there was relevant subsidy program all those cases Taxation With Representation But TWR just certainly incorrect when claims that this case fits the Speiser Perry model Therefore the actual purposes the government regulations were revealed and they were properly found difficult understand what relevance these cases can have determining whether true government subsidy condition constitutional Speiser and particularly Barnette and Wooley only provide the underlying substantive basis for Plaintiffs compelled speech claims this case just Taxation With Representation for example the underlying substantive doctrine provided that Congress would violate the First Amendment directly restricted the right lobby see Blackmun concurring citing Presidents Conference Noerr Motor Freight for the proposition that lobbying protected activity The existence underlying substantive First Amendment prohibition however did not resolve the constitutionality the condition issue Taxation With Representation nor does here Rather this case calls determine whether despite Congress broad power impose conditions federal spending funding condition that imposes affirmative speech requirement coercive equal direct compulsion speech The majority need not struggle from blank slate with determining the proper way approach this question The Supreme Court has already provided the framework for Taxation with Representation Rust and the entire line cases applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine the government subsidies those cases turned whether the alleged speech restriction was affirmative Rather the foundational principle Taxation With Representation and Rust that the government allowed insist that public funds spent for the purposes for which they were authorized Rust Sullivan The Policy Requirement this case does precisely that Congress determined that part fighting the spread the epidemic should the policy the United States eradicate rostitution also determined that desired fight specifically through strategy reduc ing behavioral risks and eliminat ing the sexual exploitation women and children therefore only authorized federal funds for organizations that shared its desire affirmatively reduce behavioral risks including its policy eradicating prostitution means this end the Agencies require recipients affirm funding award documents that they are fact opposed prostitution The Policy Requirement therefore precisely aimed Congress goal Congress did not determine the Leadership Act that wished fight through strategy remaining neutral the issue prostitution and other behavioral risks that contribute the epidemic and that would implement that strategy simply withholding funding from groups that support prostitution Rather specifically wanted eradicate prostitution and other behavioral risks While Rust Congress wished not fund abortion activities through its family planning grants here Congress sought eradicate prostitution and decided affirmatively fund only groups that shared its particular approach fighting perfectly within Congress Spending Clause powers craft condition that insist that public funds spent for the purposes for which they were authorized Rust second reason the majority concludes that affirmative speech requirements always raise serious First Amendment concerns FAIR statement that here nothing this case approaching pledge motto that the school must endorse FAIR FAIR various law schools challenged Congress decision withhold federal grants from educational institutions that denied military recruiters access equal that other recruiters The Supreme Court did not engage unconstitutional conditions analysis because concluded that the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly imposing the access requirement universities any event See declining determine when condition placed university funding goes beyond the reasonable choice offered Grove City and becomes unconstitutional condition internal quotation marks omitted that context the Supreme Court addressed the law schools argument that the access requirement constituted compelled speech because the schools were forced they sent and posted notices regarding other campus recruiters the same for military recruiters The Supreme Court set out the doctrine pursuant Barnette and Wooley and concluded that recruiting assistance far cry from the compelled speech Barnette and Wooley The Court explained that Congress restriction does not dictate the content the speech all There nothing this case approaching pledge motto that the school must endorse The Court therefore found that necessary but not sufficient element unconstitutional funding condition was absent there would underlying First Amendment violation the condition was applied directly The Court had need address whether funding condition that required recipients espouse particular message would constitutional under the First Amendment and said nothing about that issue FAIR therefore has little relevance the key issue this case for the same reason that Barnette Speiser and Wooley are not determinative There basic difference between the denial government funding and direct compulsion there doctrine that precisely addresses whether government subsidy condition constitutional pursuant the First Amendment would apply here The Policy Requirement imposes neither the two types burdens identified Regan Taxation With Representation penalizing free speech such that subsidy condition approaches the coercive effects direct restriction First the Policy Requirement does not deny any independent government benefit which Plaintiffs are otherwise entitled The only consequence Plaintiffs not subscribe the Leadership Act Policy Requirement that they will not receive Leadership Act funds This unlike Speiser and Barnette and Wooley cases where the denial independent benefits was threatened also unlike the denial all business deductions for taxpayer who lobbied contemplated Justice Douglas concurrence Cammarano United States penalty the exercise First Amendment rights The only government benefit risk the subsidy that the government chose restrict order achieve its policy Policy Requirement also does not restrict Plaintiffs First Amendment speech outside the scope the Leadership Act program This because the organizational integrity guidelines implemented the Agencies allow for exactly the affiliate structure that saved the funding conditions issue Taxation With Representation and Velazquez and was found missing FCC League Women Voters this case Plaintiffs may create affiliate organizations receive Leadership Act funds and comply with the Leadership Act Policy Requirement Plaintiffs therefore are free continue remain silent espouse message with Act funds this way the Policy Requirement coupled with the Guidelines only ensures that Leadership Act funds are spent within the scope the government program that organizations that share Congress desire eradicate the practice rostitution and other sexual victimization because they are additional causes and factors the spread the epidemic The Policy Requirement and Guidelines therefore impose penalty Plaintiffs First Amendment majority rejects the argument that the Guidelines save the Policy Requirement from infringing Plaintiffs right refrain from speaking The majority explains that previous cases affiliate provisions like the Guidelines provided outlet that allowed organizations say what was otherwise impermissibly prohibited federal subsidy programs citing Taxation With Representation and League Women Voters The majority argues that this case different because adequate alternative channel can not remedy compelled speech condition affording outlet engage privately funded silence This logic misses the point adequate alternative channels the government subsidy context and again fails account for the fact that the Policy Requirement merely subsidy condition not mandate Provisions allowing recipients government funding establish affiliate organizations either receive the government funds operate exclusively with private funds are important because they remedy one way that funding condition although merely funding condition could coercive rise the level direct restriction speech Affiliate structures prevent subsidy conditions from reaching beyond the scope the subsidy program and restricting what organization may may not say outside the scope the program this way that subsidy conditions could become penalties First Amendment rights equivalent direct restriction See Taxation With Representation The Code does not deny TWR the right receive deductible contributions support its activity Congress has merely refused pay for the lobbying out public monies the reasons explained above the fact that affirmative speech condition rather than negative speech condition issue here does not change the analysis whether subsidy condition rises the level direct regulation constitutional right See discussion supra Moreover direct restriction speech just offensive the First Amendment direct compulsion speak Riley the Blind There certainly some difference between compelled speech and compelled silence but the context protected speech the difference without constitutional significance see also Glickman Wileman Elliott Souter dissenting ompelling cognizable speech officially just suspect suppressing and typically subject the same level scrutiny and funding conditions that implicate these principles should subject the same why the District Court dismissal any saving effect the Guidelines this case because the clause requiring Plaintiffs adopt the Government view regarding prostitution remains intact Alliance for Open Agency for hereinafter AOSI and turn the majority quotation that sentence inexplicable too the majority assertion that there remains top the Guidelines the additional affirmative requirement that the recipient entity pledge its opposition prostitution bears repeating The Policy Requirement together with the Guidelines not require Plaintiffs affiliates adopt the government viewpoint regarding prostitution say anything The Policy Requirement funding condition and must analyzed pursuant the cases addressing unconstitutional conditions government subsidies Applying those cases the Policy Requirement and the Guidelines not penalize coerce First Amendment protected conduct and not compel speech outside the scope the government program For all these reasons the Policy Requirement not subject heightened First Amendment the majority does not address the issue Plaintiffs additionally argue that the Guidelines not fact provide adequate alternative channel for protected First Amendment activity because they are too burdensome practice The District Court below addressed this challenge although did error reviewing the Guidelines under heightened scrutiny have explained that heightened scrutiny undue burden test does not apply the question whether alternative channels like those issue here are fact adequate challenge Brooklyn Legal Servs Legal Servs cert denied Rather the proper question whether any burdens plaintiffs under the organizational integrity guidelines effect preclude the plaintiffs from establishing affiliate the alternative channels are inadequate and the plaintiffs may prevail their challenge Because would vacate the preliminary injunction and remand this case the District Court Plaintiffs would free raise any challenge the Guidelines under the proper Brooklyn Legal Services standard that concluding that the affirmative nature the Policy Requirement raises serious First Amendment concerns the majority ultimately asserts that heightened scrutiny applies this case because the bold combination requirement that also For the reasons explained above nothing about the affirmative nature the Policy Requirement requires heightened scrutiny apply Likewise contrary the majority suggestion funding conditions are not inherently constitutionally troublesome and the nature the funding condition issue this case does not warrant heightened conditions that discriminate the basis viewpoint are only subject heightened scrutiny when they are aimed the suppression dangerous ideas Speiser Randall internal quotation marks omitted when they are imposed the context program designed encourage diversity views facilitate private speech forum context see Rosenberger Velazquez These classes cases are not unrelated The presence viewpoint discrimination the context government program that has policy objective other than funding private speech tends demonstrate that any attached condition primarily intended influence behavior suppress certain ideas rather than achieve legitimate objective promote government message However when spending program not universal but limited providing benefits restricted number recipients the case here and Rust and when that program does not create public forum proving coercion virtually impossible because simply denying subsidy does not coerce belief and because the criterion unconstitutionality whether denial the subsidy threatens drive certain ideas viewpoints from the marketplace Velazquez Scalia dissenting internal quotation marks and citation omitted Plaintiffs not urge and the majority correctly does not conclude that the Policy Requirement aimed the suppression any dangerous ideas There simply evidence that Congress purpose enacting the Leadership Act and attaching the Policy Requirement was suppress views even neutrality the issue Congress could hardly have thought the best way suppress support for prostitution the public discourse would offer federal funds narrow range groups that wished combat but only they espoused position Both the purpose and effects the Policy Requirement are far cry from those cases where the government condition was clearly aimed the suppression compulsion speech qua speech See Grosjean Press The tax bad because the light its history and its present setting seen deliberate and calculated device the guise tax limit the circulation information see also Minneapolis Star Tribune Revenue discussing Grosjean Speiser Rather the Policy Requirement aimed achieving Congress legitimate goal eradicating prostitution and reducing behavioral risks technique fighting Moreover the organizational integrity guidelines leave Plaintiffs with precisely the same ability remain silent speak message they choose The Policy Requirement and Guidelines therefore way silence government criticism contrary views prostitution and Only affiliates that voluntarily choose accept Leadership Act funds must oppose prostitution Plaintiffs and all other speakers are free speak their own messages including messages contradictory those separate affiliate regard the second category cases the Supreme Court has recognized that the existence Government subsidy the form property does not justify the restriction speech areas that have been traditionally open the public for expressive activity Rust Sullivan internal quotation marks omitted Rosenberger Rector Visitors University Virginia and Velazquez extended this principle conclude that viewpoint discrimination improper not only traditional public fora but also cases where the government essentially creates limited public forum offer ing pay private speakers who convey their own messages Rosenberger Once the government has offered pay private speakers speak their own messages the government may not discriminate against speech otherwise within the forum limitations One example subsidy program that pays private speakers but does not create limited public forum program which the government use private speakers transmit specific information pertaining its own program Velazquez quoting Rosenberger subsidize transmittal message favors Rosenberger any event however the salient point the Supreme Court analysis those programs which viewpoint discrimination has been found improper that those programs were designed facilitate private speech Velazquez see also United States Library plurality opinion explaining that Rust does not only apply when the government seeks communicate specific message this case plain that the government does not seek encourage diversity views from private speakers did Rosenberger offering reimburse student groups for newspaper publication costs The purpose the Leadership Act not fund variety organizations interested fighting each whom might have different viewpoint prostitution and sex trafficking the contrary the Leadership Act specifically seeks advance approach combating See enacting the Leadership Act Congress made inherently judgment concerning the allocation public resources for fighting which sets the program apart from the subsidy issue Rosenberger and from comparably objective decisions allocating public benefits Endowment for the Arts Finley issue cases where viewpoint discrimination was found invalid other words public forum principles not apply this case because Congress did not authorize Leadership Act funds order create public forum for Plaintiffs express themselves Library ruling that public forum principles not apply because public library does not acquire Internet terminals order create public forum for Web publishers express themselves but rather achieve particular policy the purpose the Leadership Act not generally facilitate private speech was the purpose the LSC program the Velazquez cases those cases Congress funded LSC grantees provide attorneys represent the interests indigent clients Velazquez The LSC program was not advancing any particular set values that might diluted distorted Velazquez the speech decision not speak Indeed the LSC lawyer role specifically was speak against the government court claim for welfare benefits the speech was the behalf the lawyer private indigent client and inherently not behalf the government Velazquez Therefore the case was distinguishable from Rust because with regard the LSC program there was programmatic message the kind recognized Rust Here the contrary instead generally facilitating private speech the purpose the Leadership Act program combat particular way The government has chosen fund method combating that includes its private partners taking position the exclusion alternative program that would allow grantees remain silent the issue speak message Unlike the Velazquez cases the government set values and strategy combating would weakened diluted distorted Velazquez its partners were allowed speak message stay silent the issue matter how vehemently Plaintiffs may disagree with the government policy towards prostitution and Congress decided that part its strategy was eradicate prostitution this case like Rust the government allowed specify its grantees position prostitution deemed necessary for its legitimate objective Velazquez reducing majority rejects Rust application here because believes the Policy Requirement compels Plaintiffs voice the government viewpoint were their own First must reiterated that the Policy Requirement does not compel any speech See discussion supra Second just with the cases addressing whether subsidy conditions are coercive none the cases addressing allegedly subsidy conditions have turned whether affirmative negative speech requirement was issue Rather the salient point for analysis whether the government has effectively created limited public forum this case the government program not designed encourage diversity views from private speakers Rosenberger nor intended facilitate private speech Velazquez And funding decisions can sustained instances which the government use private speakers transmit specific information pertaining its own program internal citation omitted quoting Rosenberger majority only additional professed rationale for casting Rust and its progeny aside that the Rust Court stated that othing the challenged regulations requires doctor represent his own any opinion that does not fact hold and noted that doctor always free make clear that advice regarding abortion simply beyond the scope the program Rust Sullivan However this observation came only the Rust Court consideration the claim the plaintiffs that case that traditional relationships such that between doctor and patient should enjoy protection under the First Amendment from Government regulation even when subsidized the Government issue the Court did not reach Instead the Court concluded that because the doctors Rust were not required state any opinion that they did not hold and could simply say that abortion advice was outside the scope the program the regulations did not significantly impinge upon the relationship this case there such traditional relationship that should enjoy extra First Amendment protection nor would any relationship sensitive the relationship impinged recipient Leadership Act funds did not actually oppose prostitution and sex trafficking but said did order receive government funding The majority own example situation which believes affirmative speech requirement would permitted suggests that the risk that recipient would tempted state opinion did not hold other words lie receive government funding does not invalidate government subsidy condition The majority not doubt that the government could require grantees Just Say drugs program state that they oppose drug use children But what about potential grantees who not actually oppose drug use children but are tempted the offer funds can not that their constitutional rights are violated because condition receiving federal money they must voice the government viewpoint and were their own all this the majority concedes that the government may impose affirmative funding condition the government program effect its message perhaps the message central the program The majority however concludes that because the stated purpose the Leadership Act fight well tuberculosis and malaria Defendants can not now recast the Leadership Act global program messaging campaign footnote omitted True enough See Velazquez Congress can not recast condition funding mere definition its program every case lest the First Amendment reduced simple semantic exercise But this case not like Velazquez where the Supreme Court found that there was programmatic message the kind recognized Rust that would support restricting lawyers First Amendment rights this case the government not attempting recast program that was meant merely provide funds allow private speakers speak their own messages into program that could support the Policy Requirement Rather the Policy Requirement obviously related substantive policy goals the Leadership Act goals beyond and different from simply subsidizing private speech for its own sake See Prostitution and other sexual victimization are degrading women and children and should the policy the United States eradicate such practices directing that the President strategy fight shall make the reduction behavioral risks priority all prevention efforts eliminat ing the sexual exploitation women and children This not case where the funding condition attenuated from the purpose for which the public funds were appropriated invalidate the condition Compare South Dakota Dole concluding that while conditions federal grants might illegitimate they are unrelated the federal interest particular national projects programs the condition imposed Congress directly related one the main purposes for which highway funds are expended safe interstate travel internal quotation marks omitted with dissenting view establishment minimum drinking age not sufficiently related interstate highway construction justify conditioning funds appropriated for that purpose the majority cites support for its implication that the purpose the Leadership Act must examined the broadest possible level generality determine whether principles apply this case See The stated purpose the Leadership Act fight well tuberculosis and malaria footnote omitted There reason why government subsidy program must actually messaging campaign even have message central component order support viewpoint discriminatory condition that germane legitimate substantive goals the program Rust Rosenberger and Velazquez did not address the size number purposes any potential subsidiary issue the government programs which those cases suggested that viewpoint discriminatory conditions would majority also questions the Leadership Act commitment partnering with groups that oppose prostitution means combating because the Policy Requirement specifically exempts four groups from compliance the Global Fund Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria the World Health Organization the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and United Nations agencies see One these organizations the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative focused the development AIDS vaccine The fact that Congress determined that while generally only wished partner with groups that opposed prostitution nevertheless wanted fund research for AIDS vaccine does not call into question Congress desire eradicate prostitution part its efforts combat Congress may simply have determined that research was even more important priority The three remaining groups are public international organizations which the United States participates and which are made primarily exclusively sovereign states See generally discussing public international organizations Again nothing about the fact that Congress chose make Leadership Act funds available these international organizations without requiring them comply with the Policy Requirement undermines Congress strong desire only partner with groups that share its opposition prostitution Congress may have determined that the goals the Policy Requirement were outweighed sensitive diplomatic considerations The majority suggests that Congress truly wished support advocacy could course simply choose not fund these organizations But the decision whether withhold Leadership Act funds from these organizations instead provide exemption from the Policy Requirement precisely the kind policy judgment that Congress not the courts entitled make Regan Taxation With Representation Congressional selection particular entities persons for entitlement this sort largesse obviously matter policy and discretion not open judicial review unless circumstances which here are not able find internal quotation marks omitted the majority relies the fact that prostitution the context the international effort subject international debate and notes that concerns controversial public issue argue that Plaintiffs speech rights are important The majority also rejects Defendants argument that strict scrutiny should not apply the Policy Requirement because implicates foreign affairs But the substantive validity controversial nature Plaintiffs position prostitution and any foreign affairs repercussions for the government both are not determinative whether the Policy Requirement constitutional pursuant the unconstitutional conditions doctrine and the cases discussed above Because conclude that the Policy Requirement not subject heightened scrutiny any event need not reach these arguments Nevertheless believe observations sufficiently dispose all the reasons explained above conclude that the Policy Requirement nature permissible this case and that not subject heightened judicial plaintiff seeking preliminary injunction must establish that likely succeed the merits that likely suffer irreparable harm the absence preliminary relief that the balance equities tips its favor and that injunction the public interest Winter Natural Res Def Council review district court grant preliminary injunction for abuse discretion Alleyne State Educ district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests error law Mullins City New York internal quotation marks omitted The District Court this case granted Plaintiffs request for preliminary injunction because concluded that the Policy Requirement would not survive heightened scrutiny and also impermissibly compel speech and therefore violate the First Amendment AOSI For the reasons explained above conclude that the District Court erred because the Policy Requirement not subject heightened scrutiny does not compel speech and does not violate the First Amendment Furthermore because Congress decision enact the Policy Requirement entirely rational exercise its powers pursuant the Spending Clause would conclude that Plaintiffs have not established likelihood succeeding the merits their claim that the Policy Requirement unconstitutional Accordingly would vacate the preliminary injunction and remand the case for any further proceedings consistent with today decision the majority unnecessarily splits from the Court Appeals for the District Columbia Circuit this very issue the Circuit Court Appeals rejected almost identical challenge the Leadership Act potential grantee that refused adopt policy opposing prostitution See DKT Agency for The Court explained that the Act restrictions were permissible because the government has not created program encourage private speech did Rosenberger Rector Visitors University Virginia and FCC League Women Voters but rather Rust the government own message being delivered DKT internal quotation marks omitted While the organizational integrity guidelines were not yet place when DKT International was decided the Court also rejected the plaintiff argument that pursuant Rust funding restrictions may only apply particular projects and not recipients general The Court explained that there was constitutional violation the Leadership Act because othing prevents the plaintiff from itself remaining neutral and setting subsidiary organization that certifies has policy opposing prostitution The parent organization need not adopt the policy Finally the Court also rejected the plaintiff compelled speech challenge distinguishing Barnette Speiser and Wooley from the case before each those cases the penalty for refusing propagate the message was denial public
