gas Connecticut and New York See Islander East Pipeline pertinent part Islander East proposed construct approximately miles pipeline from interconnection with existing pipeline near North Haven Connecticut across the Long Island Sound Brookhaven New York Long Island and approximately miles pipeline from the proposed Islander East mainline near Wading River New York power plant Calverton New York Approximately miles the pipeline would cross the Long Island Sound with the remaining miles onshore See Islander East Pipeline December the FERC issued Preliminary Determination Issues relating pipeline construction which indicated that authorization for the construction and operation the proposed work would the public convenience and necessity required for approval under section the NGA See Islander East Pipeline August the FERC issued Final Environmental Impact Statement FEIS pursuant the requirements NEPA Fed Energy Regulatory Islander East Pipeline Project Final Environmental Impact Statement see also Islander East Pipeline The FEIS determined that one project system alternative Islander East proposal would environmentally preferable because that alternative based the Iroquois Pipeline ELI Extension Project had shorter Long Island Sound crossing avoided more shellfish leases and would only have air quality and noise impacts onshore Connecticut See FEIS Nevertheless the FEIS concluded that Islander East constructed the project proposed and accordance with the recommended mitigation measures would environmentally acceptable action See September the FERC issued final order granting Islander East requests for authorization construct and operate its proposed interstate natural gas pipeline conditioned its compliance with various environmental requirements prior beginning construction the pipeline Islander East Pipeline The FERC concluded that because the Islander East Project would environmentally acceptable action and because would provide significant benefits was required public convenience and necessity under the NGA The FERC pointed out that Islander East proposal would provide Long Island with second source natural gas supply providing the benefits competition and would provide second facility access natural gas supplies the event problem with one the See the CZMA and the CWA Islander East filed applications with the States New York and Connecticut seeking the following state authorizations under federal law certificate consistency with the state Coastal Zone Management Plan CZMP pursuant section the CZMA and WQC indicating consistency with the state Water Quality Standards pursuant section the CWA January and February New York granted both the necessary authorizations However the Connecticut Department Environmental Protection CTDEP denied both the CZMP and WQC East filed its application obtain WQC certification with the CTDEP February March Islander East withdrew its application and submitted new application which reflected modified offshore construction techniques aimed reducing the project environmental impacts brief Islander East proposed the use three different pipeline installation methods for the Connecticut portion the pipeline project First Islander East proposed utilize horizontal directional drill HDD construction technique initiate the pipeline installation point onshore Connecticut approximately feet inland from the shoreline that would continue until mile post The HDD method would involve drilling hole along the pipeline projected path enlarging accommodate the pipeline then pulling the pipeline into the hole The method would involve exposure the sea floor until the drill reached exit point Islander East proposed use mechanical bucket dredge excavate exit basin that would serve contain and restrict the release drill fluid the HDD exit point From the exit basin Islander East would continue use the mechanical bucket dredge excavate trench approximately order reduce the impacts sediment deposition Islander East would place dredge spoil onto hopper barges instead sidecasting onto the sea floor for later use backfill Next the pipeline would laid into the trench and the trench would covered with engineered backfill the form for the deeper waters between and Islander East proposed use vessel with plow and mooring system Using this method the towing vessel would move along the pipeline route pulling its bow anchor lines and releasing its stern anchor lines while anchor handling tug would move the anchors ahead the towing vessel minimize anchoring impacts Islander East proposed lower the pipeline with single pass the plow Following the pass backfill plow would return the displaced spoil the trench See generally Islander East Pipeline Permit Application for Water Quality Certificate Marine Pipeline Installation Methodology Pipeline Installation Methodology February the CTDEP denied Islander East application for WQC finding the proposed pipeline work inconsistent with the Connecticut Water Quality Standards CTWQS See Islander East Pipeline CTDEP Denial Letter CTDEP Denial April Islander East filed petition for declaratory ruling with the CTDEP seeking overturn the CTDEP denial certification which the CTDEP deemed procedurally deficient and June Islander East filed action Connecticut Superior Court challenging the CTDEP decision See Islander East Pipeline LLC Envtl Prot the state proceedings were pending EPACT was signed into law August That same day pursuant the newly enacted section the NGA Islander East filed petition for expedited review the CTDEP Denial with this Court see Dkt and moved stay the Connecticut state court proceedings Subsequently the CTDEP moved dismiss Islander East petition for review this court for lack subject matter jurisdiction and Islander East moved amend its petition add current CTDEP Commissioner Gina McCarthy respondent January this court ruled that would consider the above motions along with the merits Islander East East brings this petition for review contest the CTDEP denial its WQC application that may begin construction its natural gas pipeline project Petitioner contends that the denial its application for WQC prevents the construction pipeline facility subject section the NGA and violates federal law because the pipeline facility consistent with the CTWQS Thus Petitioner asks the Court find its favor both the aforementioned grounds and remand this proceeding the CTDEP with instructions issue the requested initial matter the CTDEP challenges the Court subject matter jurisdiction review this petition contending that the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments the United States Constitution bar Petitioner suit against the CTDEP the basis state sovereignty and arguing that Section EPACT may not retroactively applied confer jurisdiction this The CTDEP also asks the Court deny Petitioner motion add the Commissioner respondent arguing that the parte Young doctrine allowing suits against state officials does not provide exception the State Eleventh Amendment immunity this case See parte Young the event that the Court reaches the merits Petitioner section suit Respondent contends that the CTDEP Denial consistent with federal Jurisdiction over the CTDEP and the Eleventh Amendment The Eleventh Amendment provides that United States courts may not consider any suit law equity commenced prosecuted against one the United States Citizens another State Const amend Although not clear from the terms the amendment the Supreme Court has interpreted this language bar suit against state its own citizens See Seminole Tribe Florida citing Hans Louisiana The Supreme Court also applies this immunity suits against state agencies See Pennhurst State Sch Hosp Halderman holding that the absence consent suit which the State one its agencies departments named the defendant proscribed the Eleventh Amendment argues that section the NGA violates the Eleventh Amendment because permits private company bring suit federal court challenge decision state agency Respondent acknowledges two circumstances which private citizens may sue state agencies federal court when Congress unequivocally expresses its intent abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant valid grant constitutional authority see Fitzpatrick Bitzer and when State voluntarily waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity see Coll Sav Bank Prepaid Postsecondary Educ Expense inferring State waiver immunity from the State acceptance gratuity offered Congress conditioned the State willingness subject suit federal court Respondent argues that the CTDEP entitled presumption immunity and that neither the above exceptions Eleventh Amendment immunity exist here See stating that ourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver sovereign immunity quoting Aetna Ins Kennedy rel Bogash East analogizes the Court jurisdiction under section the NGA the federal regulatory scheme established the Telecommunications Act TCA and argues that state agencies regulating pursuant federal grants under the authority both the NGA and the TCA thereby waive their sovereign immunity from suit passing the TCA Congress federalized the regulation competition for local telecommunications service but granted states limited right regulate conditioned federal court review state regulatory decisions MCI Telecomm Bell Under the TCA state chooses not regulate regulatory reverts back the Federal Communications Commission see also providing that under the CWA state refuses declines rule WQC application within one year regulatory reverts back federal authorities The Courts Appeals that have considered the issue have uniformly held that state agencies that regulate agreements under the TCA knowingly waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity voluntarily accepting the power regulate local telecommunications competition See Bell state commission that decides participate this statutory scheme notice from the outset that will subject suit brought only federal court any party aggrieved its decision BellSouth Telecomms MCI Telecomms Bell Tel MCI Telecomms Pub Serv But see Bell Atl MCI Worldcom vacated other grounds sub nom Verizon Pub Serv with the TCA Congress wholly preempted and completely federalized the area natural gas regulation enacting the NGA See Schneidewind ANR Pipeline describing the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme the NGA Congress did not however thereby supersede any other federal statutory requirements such section the CWA Under the CWA described supra page Congress provides states with the option being deputized regulators under the authority federal Without suggesting that states are required relinquish their sovereign immunity with regard all actions they take pursuant the CWA Petitioner argues that section the NGA does require waiver state sovereign immunity with respect state agency decisions that are appealable under the EPACT terms Thus Petitioner contends that Connecticut effectively waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity electing participate the regulatory scheme provided the NGA and the does not dispute that accepting role deputized regulator under the CWA state agrees waive its immunity from suit under section the NGA Instead Respondent argues that never waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit under section because this provision was passed into law only after the CTDEP denied Islander East WQC application Thus Respondent argues that Connecticut did not knowingly agree that its participation the NGA and CWA regulatory scheme would conditioned upon accepting federal jurisdiction over its decisions made pursuant that argument flawed fatal omission Respondent does not assert that Connecticut ever withdrew its participation from the CWA and NGA regulatory scheme following the enactment the EPACT Thus going forward with its federally deputized role even after the EPACT enactment Connecticut has now knowingly waived its immunity from section suit order receive the benefits participating the NGA and CWA regulatory scheme See Lapides Regents noting that more than century ago this Court indicated that State voluntary appearance federal court amounted waiver its Eleventh Amendment immunity citing Clark Barnard Coll Sav Bank Prepaid Postsecondary Educ Expense noting that state constructively waives its Eleventh Amendment immunity accepting gift gratuity conditioned said waiver case point the CTDEP Denial continues prevent Islander East from proceeding with its natural gas pipeline project and the CTDEP has chosen defend its denial Islander East WQC application this litigation The principles underlying State sovereign immunity not justify applying Connecticut waiver solely prospective basis that only for new CWA determinations especially where the state decision continues serve bar proceeding with federally approved natural gas project This conclusion particularly warranted where this case after the state becomes aware that subject federal jurisdiction continues actively litigate defense its earlier decision and elects not abdicate its deputized authority back the federal government See BellSouth fter College Savings Congress may still obtain voluntary waiver state Eleventh Amendment immunity the waiver can inferred from the state conduct accepting gratuity after being given clear and unambiguous statutory notice that was conditioned waiver immunity see also Charter Oak noting that the doctrine waiver litigation derives not from state actual preference desire but rather upon the judicial need avoid inconsistency anomaly and unfairness quoting Lapides Regents Thus conclude that once Congress enacted section Connecticut was notice that its continued participation the NGA and CWA regulatory scheme would constitute waiver its Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect all suits under section this case Connecticut knowingly and intelligently waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity from section suit Because hold that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar Petitioner suit against the CTDEP unnecessary for consider Petitioner motion add the Commissioner Respondent address the application the parte Young doctrine suits under section Therefore Petitioner motion add the Commissioner denied Tenth Amendment The Tenth Amendment prescribes that powers not delegated the United States the Constitution nor prohibited the States are reserved the States respectively the people Const amend Thus cases involving the division authority between federal and state governments power delegated Congress the Constitution the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation that power the States power attribute state sovereignty reserved the Tenth Amendment necessarily power the Constitution has not conferred Congress New York United States here Congress has the authority regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause the Supreme Court has recognized Congress power offer States the choice regulating that activity according federal standards having state law federal regulation Congress offer shared regulatory authority does not run afoul the Tenth Amendment See Hodel Surface Mining Recl fail see why the statute issue should become constitutionally suspect simply because Congress chose allow the States regulatory role this case there question that the Federal Government under the Commerce Clause the Constitution Art has dominion the exclusion the States over navigable waters the United States City Tacoma Taxpayers Tacoma enacting the CWA Congress provided states with offer shared regulatory authority See Arkansas Oklahoma stating that the CWA anticipates partnership between the States and the Federal Government animated shared objective Respondent does not dispute that under the CWA the Federal Government elected maintain control over the mechanism regulating discharges into navigable waters Rather Respondent argues that federal court review WQC decision infringes upon Connecticut jurisdiction over its own public trust lands the land underlying the Long Island Sound See Idaho Coeur Tribe Idaho concluding that the court order sought would divest the State its sovereign control over submerged lands lands with unique status the law and infused with public trust the State itself bound respect Utah Div State Lands United States stating that lands underlying navigable waters have historically been considered sovereign lands and state ownership them considered essential attribute sovereignty Supreme Court cases cited Respondent are inapposite and conclude that granting Islander East petition for review would not interfere with Connecticut control over its sovereign lands The Supreme Court decisions Coeur and Utah Div State Lands involved challenges state sovereignty over state land Coeur private party brought action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the State claiming ownership various submerged lands while Utah Div State Lands the State brought action for declaratory and injunctive relief contending that was the owner lake bed Here the grant denial WQC does not involve issue land ownership Islander East authorization exercise the power eminent domain obtain right way for the natural gas pipeline unquestionably comes from the FERC accordance with its authority under the NGA Thus this case federal court review involves infringement state jurisdiction over its lands Such review most intrudes upon the State authority determine whether the anticipated construction Islander East federally approved pipeline the land issue satisfies state water quality standards The exercise this authority not sovereign state right under the Tenth Amendment Rather Congress has the authority regulate discharges into navigable waters under the Commerce Clause and the State this case exercises only such authority has been delegated Congress Accordingly there basis for Respondent Tenth Amendment challenge Islander East petition for Retroactivity NGA Section Respondent argues that can not sued under NGA section because section does not state that retroactive and the CTDEP Denial was issued eighteen months before the statute enactment Landgraf USI Film the Supreme Court held that ven absent specific legislative authorization application new statutes passed after the events suit unquestionably proper many situations The Court explained that statutes applying new jurisdictional rules are typically retroactive because such statutes regulate the conduct the courts not the parties have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring ousting jurisdiction whether not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred when the suit was filed Application new jurisdictional rule usually takes away substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that hear the case Present law normally governs such situations because jurisdictional statutes speak the power the court rather than the rights obligations the parties Because rules procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct the fact that new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise the suit does not make application the rule internal citations and quotation marks omitted accord Hughes Aircraft United States Respondent correct noting that presumption against retroactivity applies when new provisions affect contractual property rights See Landgraf USI Film The largest category cases which have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual property rights matters which predictability and stability are prime importance But discussed above the context Respondent Tenth Amendment challenge section did not affect any Connecticut contractual otherwise The CTDEP ability issue WQCs was conferred the federal government which has exclusive control over navigable waterways CTDEP therefore lacks independent rights its WQC the CTDEP did have property contract rights under the CWA section would not affect its exercise those rights The CTDEP still entitled make WQC determinations those determinations simply are now reviewed federal court opposed state court Thus conclude that section applies retroactively and its provision exclusive jurisdiction this court controls this Merits Petitioner Section Standard Proceeding the merits first address the standard review applied reviewing action under section the NGA Section provides for remand where the state agency action inconsistent with the Federal law governing such action and would prevent the construction expansion operation the facility subject the NGA Here there dispute that the CTDEP Denial preventing the construction the pipeline project the only question whether the CTDEP Denial inconsistent with federal law Although the statute does not prescribe the applicable standard review for this question both parties suggest that the appropriate standard the traditional arbitrary and capricious standard for review federal agency decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act APA See definition the APA applies only federal agency actions see however the context the TCA federal courts have used the arbitrary and capricious standard when reviewing the merits state agency decisions made pursuant federal law See Bell Tel MFS Intelenet West Sprint Bell Tel Waller Creek West MFS Intelenet Specifically reviewing challenges state agency interconnection agreement rulings under review provision the TCA analogous that NGA section see federal courts have adopted approach See Bell Courts first review novo whether the state agency complied with the requirements the relevant federal law See illegality uncovered during such review the court then analyzes the state agency factual determinations under the more deferential standard review usually accorded state administrative bodies assessments state law principles see also Ace Tel Koppendrayer apply the same standard NGA review Here there question that the CTDEP complied with federal law applying its state water quality standards Islander East permit application directed the CWA See Therefore proceed directly analysis the CTDEP factual determinations under the arbitrary and capricious standard See the arbitrary and capricious standard agency the relevant data and articulate satisfactory explanation for its action including rational connection between the facts found and the choice made reviewing that explanation must consider whether the decision was based consideration the relevant factors and whether there has been clear error judgment Normally agency rule would arbitrary and capricious the agency has

articulated the agency itself citation omitted The CTDEP the instant case the CTDEP denied Islander East WQC application brief letter denial determining that the proposed work the proposed location inconsistent with the Water Quality Standards because the project would adversely affect water quality and prohibit the existing and designated uses the receiving waters CTDEP Denial The CTDEP cited three bases for its conclusion temporary water quality disturbance and habitat alteration would inconsistent with the CTWQS Surface Water Quality Standard degradation water quality and disruption existing uses would inconsistent with the policy set forth the CTWQS and disruption habitat would inconsistent with section the Connecticut Coastal Management Act CCMA The CTDEP explained that hese elements not stand alone but must read such fashion internally consistent within the Water Quality Standards and consistent with the goals the CWA Based close analysis the CTDEP justifications and the record conclude that the CTDEP did not adequately examine the relevant record evidence and failed articulate rational connections between the facts the record and the bases for its decision explain our conclusion examine each the agency three grounds for the Water Quality Impacts and Habitat The CTDEP determined that the dredging plowing backfilling equipment anchoring and anchor cable sweeping associated with pipeline installation would cause temporary water quality disturbance permanent change the benthic substrate and negative impacts the aquatic biota which found inconsistent with the goal the CTWQS restore maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity surface waters CTDEP Denial the CTDEP Denial installation would cause direct disturbance the benthic substrate sea floor and would result turbidity the water column followed sediment deposition the benthic substrate support this conclusion the Denial cited study estimating that between and millimeters sediment would deposited and around the pipeline trench area citing Letter from John Roberge Anthony DaRos First Selectman Town Branford Roberge Report The Denial determined that this disturbance would permanently change the benthic substrate and negatively impact the existing aquatic biota that depend such substrate thus concluded that combined assaults direct habitat disturbance and temporary water quality impacts would negatively impact the overall biological integrity the Thimble Islands ecosystem Other than the Roberge Report however the Denial cited studies record evidence support this the CTDEP Denial concluded that direct habitat disturbance caused sediment deposition would dramatically alter natural habitats and adversely impact the existing community organisms Specifically the Denial noted that once the original seabed has been disturbed the late successional stage species such clams and oysters that lived the original substrate can longer exist and that instead opportunistic species such polychaete worms would populate the new habitat The CTDEP concluded that was uncertain whether the associated diverse assemblage bottom dwelling organisms currently present this area could reestablished because studies exist from which one may predict known recovery time for both these benthic communities and the substrate indeed there any significant recovery The only record evidence support this conclusion was report issued Peter Pellegrino entitled Macrobenthic Community Structure Along the Proposed Islander East Pipeline Route Long Island Sound Pellegrino Report which was cited the CTDEP without discussion its Impact Water record shows that the pipeline installation impact water quality would and Respondent does not suggest that such result would inconsistent with the CTWQS See acknowledging that urbidity the water column would relatively FEIS stating belief that impacts water quality the Sound near the Connecticut shore would nature because elevated turbidity levels caused sediment dispersion through the water column typically return background levels within days completion backfilling and therefore impacts Long Island Sound water quality should last more than several months John Roberge Potential Sedimentation Impacts Which Could Result from Dredging Roberge Report noting that dredging the Long Island Sound historically causes suspended sediment concentrations returning levels almost immediately following cessation the trenching operations TRC Envtl Evaluation Benthic Impacts Associated with Islander East Modified Offshore Construction Techniques TRC Report estimating that organisms along the pipeline route would exposed increased turbidity any one location for only around hours Thus not read the CTDEP Denial place significant reliance the pipeline project temporary impact water Impact Sediment Deposition and Direct Disturbance Benthic Substrate and Natural the CTDEP acknowledged that the water quality disturbance caused pipeline installation was not particularly problematic did conclude that the sediment deposition and direct benthic substrate disturbances resulting from installation would permanently change the substrate and negatively impact the existing aquatic biota that depend such substrate CTDEP Denial The CTDEP cited scientific studies other evidence that directly supported the latter findings and the Denial failed acknowledge respond contradictory data the analysis the record reveals considerable evidence indicating that direct pipeline installation and accompanying sediment deposition would not have permanent effect the benthic environment For example the FEIS noted that although most sessile benthic organisms and demersal fish eggs the disturbed area would smothered sediment most fish and mobile benthic organisms would relocate and avoid FEIS The FEIS concluded that recovery most the disturbed benthic communities along the pipeline route could expected occur within years see also predicting the recovery disturbed shellfish beds within years reports prepared for both Islander East and the Town Branford projected similar limited impacts The TRC Report prepared for Islander East concluded that onsidering only the maximum estimates sediment deposition and the predictions are correct this degree sediment deposition onto the sea floor should have little impact sea floor habitats and communities and may approach levels sediment resuspension and deposition the Report quoting the opinion Roman Zajac independent marine biologist consulting the project see also concluding that mortality expected and stress factors will minimal result sediment deposition caused pipeline installation with feet depth cover Similarly the Garrett Group Report prepared for the town Branford concluded that the anticipated bottom damage caused construction would alter existing productive shellfish habitat and existing invertebrate community structure but that fter all project related activities and secondary conditions associated with the construction have ceased the bottom will recover after several years and return the existing condition Garrett Group Preliminary Report the Anticipated Biological Impacts Associated with the Proposed Islander East Pipeline Project Garrett Report emphasis added see also Additionally the Pellegrino Report cited the Denial explicitly discusses the recovery process after sediment deposition noting that the process typically concludes with the reestablishment species Denial thus failed mention that least four scientific studies the record concluded that the substrate was capable return its existing directly opposite its conclusion that pipeline installation would permanently change the substrate and dramatically alter natural habitats Denial Such failure alone could deemed arbitrary and capricious See State Farm noting that agency failure offer explanation for its decision that runs counter the evidence before arbitrary and capricious Additionally the CTDEP conclusion that studies existed from which known recovery time for both these benthic communities and the substrate could predicted Denial was manifestly contradicted the above studies two which provided specific recovery time estimates and none which predicted permanent alteration the benthic CTDEP Denial cited two studies during its analysis the project impact the benthic substrate however neither these studies supported its conclusion that the benthic substrate would permanently changed and the surrounding natural habitats would dramatically alter The Denial cited the Roberge Report simply source for its citation the amount sediment deposition that would result from pipeline See Denial The Roberge Report does not make any predictions the impact this activity water quality the benthic substrate the aquatic habitat See Roberge Report stating that going forward essential that the potential impacts upon pelagic demersal and benthic fauna well subtidal flora imposed the sedimentation processes evaluated and quantified Indeed any conclusions that Roberge later made mortality caused sedimentation apparently were drawn from the Garrett Report which found that sedimentation would not cause permanent See Roberge Report discussing Garrett Report conclusions regarding sedimentation Denial also cited the Pellegrino Report support its description the changes that the benthic substrate would undergo result disturbance caused pipeline installation However rather than commenting the damage that such disturbances cause the Pellegrino Report describes the natural recovery process from such disturbances concluding that such recovery matter course See Pellegrino Report anything the Pellegrino Report demonstrates that benthic communities are naturally shaped disturbances similar those that would caused the Islander East pipeline project structure benthic communities usually controlled infrequent severe events disturbances that disrupt the community and return the successional process earlier stage Disturbances can physical biotic chemical nature and may have multiple direct and indirect impacts community structure The recovery process communities characterized succession community types usually beginning with the appearance opportunistic species Stage and progressing the establishment high order Stage III successional assemblages Report Indeed the FEIS confirms this assessment stating that fine sediments along coastal margins are regularly resuspended tidal currents FEIS sum see rational connection between the CTDEP conclusion that the pipeline project would cause permanent harmful change the benthic substrate and the record evidence cited the CTDEP Further the CTDEP offers explanation for dismissing record evidence that runs counter its findings Neither the studies cited the CTDEP support its conclusion that pipeline installation and resultant sediment deposition would permanently change the benthic substrate and dramatically alter the surrounding natural habitat Denial The dissent points portions the record indicating that installation would directly harm large areas the substrate disturb shellfish habitats and cause significant shellfish mortality certain locations See post However may not supply reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given State Farm not our province mine the record for evidence that would support the Denial Even such evidence exists the agency task conduct thorough examination the record explain why has rejected ignored contradictory evidence and come decision supported substantial evidence the record its first basis for its Denial the CTDEP did none the Antidegradation The CTDEP also concluded that the proposed pipeline construction would violate the policy set forth the CTWQS which requires the maintenance and protection water quality high quality waters and protection and maintenance existing uses all cases CTWQS Appx According the CTDEP where water quality better than the criteria established the Water Quality Standards such existing high quality must maintained except under exceptional and very limited circumstances CTDEP Denial CTDEP determined that the high quality waters the Thimble Islands ecosystem would degraded because the discharge backfill associated with pipeline installation would result approximately acres nearshore bottom habitat being permanently degraded and rendered unsuitable for supporting the diverse assemblage shellfish and other bottom dwelling organisms currently inhabiting this area The CTDEP concluded that impact shellfish harvesting would extend well beyond the acres direct disturbance because the gravel used engineered backfill would interfere with harvesting techniques the CTDEP concluded that the resulting topographic irregularities over the entire Islander East corridor caused sedimentation backfill with gravel plow utilization anchor strikes and cable sweeps would adversely affect the population resident benthic organisms and shellfish well the efficiency and safety the existing shellfish harvesting operations and handling shellfish harvesting equipment The CTDEP dismissed unrealistic Islander East projection that would achieve finished substrate with topographic variations more than explaining that based the experience the Department with the installation the Iroquois pipeline the Department does not agree that such minimal impact restoration the work site contours can practice achieved The CTDEP also appeared dismiss even Islander East proposed minimal variation rate unacceptable because traditional shellfish harvesting techniques were employed throughout the pipeline route See The CTDEP did not cite any studies record evidence support these Impacts Existing Shellfish mentioned above the CTDEP Denial asserts that sedimentation backfill with gravel plow utilization anchor strikes and cable sweeps would impact the entire acre pipeline corridor adversely affecting benthic organisms and shellfish well the efficiency and safety the existing shellfish harvesting operations CTDEP Denial The Denial however fails support its contention that acres Connecticut surface waters would disturbed and fails identify with any specificity the shellfish communities that would impacted the CTDEP Denial points evidence supporting its claim that area acres would impacted This apparent assumption belied evidence the record which the CTDEP did not address The FEIS refers total impacted area only acres across the entire project including New York and Connecticut waters FEIS finding total disturbance acres including subsea plowing with buoys HDD exit hole and dredge trench and associated spoil mounds The FEIS calculation acres itself likely exaggerated because based Islander East proposal before Islander East agreed ship approximately cubic yards dredged material away See Islander East Pipeline Offshore Dredge Disposal Permit Amendment July see also TRC Report discussing changes proposed construction methodologies that would reduce impact area HDD exit hole and narrow the dredging trench explain clearly how the pipeline would degrade particular area the CTDEP must first define the area question The CTDEP Denial fails address this important aspect the problem State Farm Similarly the Denial cites threat commercial interests that collect shellfish using traditional harvest shellfishing techniques the affected area CTDEP Denial CTDEP asserts general terms that the pipeline sited within and adjacent extensive shellfish grants leased shellfish grounds and public shellfishing lands yet fails point even one specific lease that would impacted Furthermore the Denial repeated reference dredging plowing backfilling equipment anchoring and anchor cable sweeping see obscures the fact that these activities would occur discrete areas and that particular shellfish beds the extent they actually reside near the construction zone would subject different potential injuries different Although may argued that the FEIS contains description shellfish beds and leases that lie the pipeline path see FEIS may not supply rationale for agency action where the agency has provided none nor may construct support for agency conclusion when the agency has not pointed evidence the record favoring its decision See State Farm The reviewing court should not attempt itself make for such deficiencies may not supply reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given Impact discussed above the CTDEP failed cite any record evidence supporting its conclusion that pipeline installation would permanently degrade the benthic substrate along the pipeline route similarly failed point any record evidence supporting its conclusion that the use engineered gravel trench backfill would permanently degrade the nearshore bottom rendering unsuitable for shellfish and other the contrary the record reflects that Islander East use engineered backfill was proposed serve beneficial purpose and indeed would have benefitted shellfish habitats Midway through Islander East planning process representative from the National Marine Fisheries Service expressed concern that trench backfill would cause damage commercial shellfish operations See Elizabeth Dolezal Islander East Pipeline LLC Project Meeting Minutes Multi Agency Construction Consultation Minutes subsequent meeting representative from the Connecticut Bureau Aquaculture suggested that Islander East use engineered backfill which would more conducive shellfish Elizabeth Dolezal Islander East Pipeline LLC Project Meeting Minutes Multi Agency Construction Consultation March March Minutes general discussion about the Iroquois installation resulted agreement that installation methods have greatly improved and that engineered backfilling process and equipment being considered Islander East have the potential result the restoration shellfish habitat several studies the record commissioned both proponents and opponents the pipeline support the conclusion that the use engineered backfill could produce future habitats even more diverse than those currently existing See TRC Report Engineered backfill has value hard substrate for attachment organisms and plants which could promote habitat diversity This new substrate mosaic created the backfill has the potential increase habitat diversity supporting greater species richness than single substrate type see also use engineered backfill may increase biological diversity and has the potential improve conditions for two valuable commercial species oyster and lobster Garrett Report The use engineered fill will create varied benthic habitat and should enhance nearshore bottom conditions The CTDEP failure acknowledge this record evidence directly contradicting its conclusion arbitrary and capricious See State Farm holding that agency failure consider important aspect the problem offer explanation for its decision that runs counter the evidence before the agency arbitrary and capricious One document the record supports the CTDEP conclusion that shellfish harvesting will negatively affected engineered backfill See Roberge Report predicting that proposed engineered backfill would significantly alter the existing benthic communities within the construction footprint and surmising that the backfill may completely change the fisheries within the trench band and could require commercial fishing operations either abandon the area employ revised methods The CTDEP however did not cite this document its Denial nor did support its conclusions with any scientific data from the record mentioned above reviewing courts may not attempt make for deficiencies agency decisions may not supply reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given State Farm must uphold agency decisions less than ideal clarity however where the record directly contradicts the unsupported reasoning the agency and the agency fails support its pronouncements with data evidence may not defer the Supreme Court has held are findings and analysis here justify the choice made indication the basis which the agency exercised its expert discretion Expert discretion the lifeblood the administrative process but unless make the requirements for administrative action strict and demanding expertise the strength modern government can become monster which rules with practical limits its internal quotation marks omitted iii Impact Topographic CTDEP justified its finding that Islander East would able achieve its benthic topography restoration goal solely referencing its experience with the installation the Iroquois Pipeline Denial Again the agency cited data studies support this the Denial points record evidence demonstrating that the Iroquois project permanently degraded the benthic substrate Long Island Sound waters Even the record contained evidence indicating that those waters have yet recover again emphasize that not our province mine the record for data supporting the agency blanket and more important the CTDEP failed acknowledge the extensive work Islander East did modernize and improve its technology avoid causing similar environmental harm that wrought the Iroquois Pipeline Islander East proposed use HDD technology drill under the seabed not disturb the sea floor opposed Iroquois which dredged the seafloor from the shore the water mark place dredge spoil barges and backfill trenches with engineered gravel designed increase habitat diversity whereas Iroquois sidecast dredged material back onto the sea floor and backfilled the trenches with some the sidecast spoil and restore the sea bottom contours without dragging steel box over the sea floor Iroquois had done the request CTDEP apparently with unfortunate results See generally Islander East WQC Application Additionally indicated the record was acknowledged two meetings that installation technology has significantly improved since the Iroquois line installation Minutes see also March Minutes general discussion about the Iroquois installation resulted agreement that installation methods have greatly improved Denial neglected even mention these proposed installation improvements much less point evidence indicating that they would have been inadequate avoid the topographic irregularities caused the Iroquois installation Although the dissent points out see post was Islander East burden demonstrate its entitlement favorable action its WQC application was the CTDEP burden adequately consider important aspects the issue See State Farm rejecting Islander East topography predictions out hand with discussion its attempts improve construction methods the agency failed examine the relevant data and articulate satisfactory explanation for its action including rational connection between the facts found and the choice made internal quotation marks omitted CTDEP conclusion that the proposed pipeline would violate its antidegradation policy was unsupported and contradicted evidence the record and therefore must rejected arbitrary and Connecticut Coastal Management the third basis for its WQC Denial the CTDEP concluded that the proposed pipeline violates the Connecticut Coastal Management Act CCMA which requires that WQCs comport with the CCMA goals and policies See Denial Islander East argues that such consideration was inappropriate because the CWA requires that WQC determinations grounded only state water quality standards not extraneous state statutes Counsel for the CTDEP concedes that the CCMA was not independent basis for denial and explains that the Denial passing mention the CCMA was merely observation that the project would have adverse impacts upon existing resources relating directly the Connecticut Water Quality Standards antidegradation policy Respondent The Denial discussion the CCMA certainly appeared more than passing mention was framed one three main reasons supporting the decision deny Islander East application Nevertheless the court will deem counsel concession waiver the CCMA independent basis for the Denial and need not decide whether might properly have constituted independent ground for decision light our determinations that the CTDEP other two justifications for its Denial were insufficient must therefore conclude that the Denial whole was arbitrary and capricious and can not support the agency decision deny Islander East WQC Miscellaneous Factors Supporting the Arbitrary and Capricious Two additional factors contribute our conclusion that the Denial arbitrary and capricious First the Denial brevity troubling After page introduction the Denial contains mere pages analysis supported five record citations none which for reasons already discussed reasonably support the broad conclusions reached points comparison the two other governmental entities that have considered the Islander East project date FERC and the Secretary each issued voluminous reports the potential environmental effects the proposed pipeline The FEIS issued FERC spanned hundreds pages and included citations all available evidence its table contents alone was almost long the CTDEP Denial See FEIS The Secretary Commerce determination was fifty pages long and included record citations not suggest that would have been impossible for the CTDEP issue well reasoned and adequately supported WQC determination shorter report than those FERC the Secretary Commerce note simply that the complexity the matter under consideration did not lend itself easily brief analysis Thus when the CTDEP failures provide record support for its conclusions and discuss evidence the contrary are considered together with the surprising brevity its Denial decision the latter fact only reinforces our conclusion that the challenged decision arbitrary and Additionally there some evidence the record suggesting that CTDEP knew was not adequately prepared support the Denial and that its issuance had become more matter strategy opposing the pipeline than See CTDEP email from Sue Jacobson Peter Francis and Ron Rozsa May met with folks from the office this morning and they were aghast that have not yet begun collecting the data CTDEP email from Jane Stahl Peter Francis May surprises Islander East response and think any change our strategy CTDEP email from Sue Jacobson Jonathan Goldman biggest hook will the pipeline potential lower surface water quality CTDEP email from Peter Francis Betsey Wingfield Sue and did some work the letter this week but still feels incomplete and bit effort the CTDEP pursue strategy justify foreordained opposition the pipeline would incompatible with reviewing agency mandate use its expertise come reasoned decision supported substantial evidence fulfilling its statutory prerogative review Islander East WQC application CTDEP was entrusted with identifying the conditions for construction that would adequately safeguard the environment the extent some evidence indicates greater concern with mounting public relations campaign preclude building the pipeline than with neutrally evaluating the record evidence that evidence further supports the conclusion that the Denial was arbitrary and the foregoing reasons conclude that the CTDEP Denial Islander East application for WQC was arbitrary and capricious draw conclusion whether the record evidence obligates the CTDEP grant Islander East application require only that the CTDEP conduct the sort complete and reasoned review required law Accordingly Remand the CTDEP conduct the type review contemplated federal law within days issuance this opinion the CTDEP

the State the nearshore waters the Thimble Islands complex the Town Branford Overall chemical and bacteriological water quality conditions this location are consistently excellent concert with excellent water quality the Thimble Islands region also exhibits abundance high quality habitat These physical conditions combine support diverse and abundant assemblage marine life The United States

levels and other environmental impacts that affect shellfish and benthic abundance The shellfish industry and use Connecticut fact Connecticut shellfish industry produces the highest quality oysters the United States shellfishing industry the Thimble Islands region thrives because the excellent water quality and exceptional habitat conditions water sufficiently high quality allow for direct consumption shellfish from these beds without the requirement for relocation and depuration the shellfish prior human consumption waters off Branford support approximately shellfishing areas approved for direct harvest eastern Connecticut proposed installation would include dredging plowing backfilling equipment anchoring and anchor cable sweeping These activities would result negative impacts both the water quality and substrate Turbidity the water column would relatively When this material precipitates out the water column will result sediment deposition the benthic substrate the request the Town Branford Blue Ribbon Committee John Roberge LLC prepared assessment sedimentation impacts associated with pipeline installation modified Islander East mitigate sediment dispersion The following sediment deposition pattern was estimated Roberge study meters from the trench centerline approximately acres meters from the trench centerline approximately acres Department has determined that the negative impacts resulting from this depositional layer addition direct substrate disturbance associated with dredging plowing backfilling equipment anchoring and anchor cable sweeping are inconsistent with the Water Quality Standards Pipeline installation would not only temporarily disturb water quality would permanently change the substrate and negatively impact the existing aquatic biota that depend such substrate The Connecticut Water Quality Standards define biological integrity the ability any aquatic ecosystem support and maintain balanced integrated adaptive community organisms having species composition diversity and functional organization comparable that the natural habitats region The combined assaults direct habitat disturbance and temporary water quality impacts resulting sediment deposition negatively impact the overall biological integrity the Thimbles sic Islands ecosystem and are therefore inconsistent with Standard the Connecticut Water Quality installation through the Thimble Islands ecosystem will dramatically alter natural habitats and adversely impact the existing community organisms discussed study entitled Macrobenthic Community Structure Along The Proposed Islander East Pipeline Route Long Island Sound Pellegrino there are dramatic differences community structure associated with disturbed versus substrate Once the original bottom has been disturbed soft sediment referred the nephloide layer covers the bottom and fills any depressions left the disturbed surface Thus the late successional stage species such clams and

diverse assemblage bottom dwelling organisms currently present this area could reestablished studies exist from which one may predict known recovery time for both these benthic communities and the substrate indeed there any significant Decision footnotes omitted emphases added Thus clear that CTDEP denied Islander East application based principally the finding short that its project were carried out where now there abundance oysters and clams there could well only worms CTDEP also noted that the Connecticut antidegradation policy requires the maintenance and protection water quality areas and mandates that existing uses must continue supported all cases Decision The Decision stated that the above findings showed that the Islander East pipeline would not consistent with this policy previously described the pipeline proposed sited within and adjacent extensive shellfish grants leased shellfish grounds and public shellfish lands The discharge backfill associated with pipeline installation would result approximately acres nearshore bottom habitat being permanently degraded and rendered unsuitable for supporting the diverse assemblage shellfish and other bottom dwelling organisms currently inhabiting this The Decision concluded that CTDEP that the regulated activity the proposed location will permanently alter the existing high quality physical and biological integrity and productivity this area the extent that the existing uses for habitat for marine fish other aquatic life and wildlife and shellfish harvesting for direct human consumption will impaired Essential shellfish habitat will lost due the temporary and permanent alteration the benthic environment resulting from the proposed work Finally the siting the dependent pipeline through prime shellfish habitat would cause significant and permanent adverse impact use displacing the use shellfishing with the use natural gas emphases added majority states that CTDEP failed cite any studies record evidence support its findings See Majority Opinion ante The CTDEP cited scientific studies other evidence that directly supported the findings that the sediment deposition and direct benthic substrate disturbances resulting from installation would permanently change the substrate and negatively impact the existing aquatic biota that depend such substrate quoting Decision The majority also states that mention that least four scientific studies the record concluded that the substrate was capable return its existing directly opposite its conclusion that pipeline installation would permanently change the substrate and dramatically alter natural habitats Opinion ante quoting Decision these opposite opinions the majority apparently refers opinion consulting marine biologist Roman Zajac Zajac opinion report TRC Environmental entitled Evaluation Benthic Impacts Associated with Islander East Modified Offshore Construction Techniques TRC Report which quotes and relies the Zajac opinion report the Garrett Group entitled Preliminary Report the Anticipated Biological Impacts Associated with the Proposed Islander East Pipeline Project Through the Nearshore Area Long Island Connecticut Garrett Group Report and the Pellegrino Report See Majority Opinion ante both the contention that CTDEP cited nothing support its findings and the contention that CTDEP failed consider the opposite opinions are contradicted the record First CTDEP pointed out that coastal engineering consultant John Roberge had prepared assessment sedimentation impacts associated with pipeline installation modified Islander East mitigate sediment dispersion Decision and attached his series reports the Decision Appendix see The Roberge Reports predicted that benthic species will likely killed even areas receiving thin veneer deposited sediments Roberge Report dated February Roberge Report dated September and that his seafloor burial has the potential result significant mortality within the benthic communities Roberge Report dated February Roberge Report dated September making this prediction the Roberge Reports stated inter alia that the Islander East pipeline would cover acres with sediment and cover acres with sediment and noted that study the United States Army Corps Engineers had found that sediment deposits will cause mortality and deposits will cause mortality some benthic species Roberge Report dated February emphasis added Roberge Report dated September emphasis added This evidence supported CTDEP finding that the Islander East pipeline would have adverse and permanent effect the makeup the benthic the Roberge Reports expressly mentioned two the studies which the majority relies for the opposite conclusion reported the Preliminary Report the Anticipated Biological Impacts Associated with the Proposed Islander East Pipeline Project through the Nearshore Area Long Island prepared The Garrett Group LTD and dated May near and deposition suspended solids may cause measurable cover thin veneer fine particles cover over proximal hard bottom substrate The Garrett report references benthic studies performed the Army Corps Engineers LaSalle all sic which note contrary Zajac opinion that sediment deposits will cause mortality and deposits will cause mortality some benthic Decision Appendix Roberge Report dated February emphases added Roberge Report dated September emphases added Although the majority opinion states that any conclusions that Roberge made mortality caused sedimentation apparently were drawn from the Garrett Report which found that sedimentation would not cause permanent damage Majority Opinion ante emphasis added plain from the above language the Roberge Reports themselves that the Roberge Reports explicitly rejected the views the Garrett Group and Zajac light the contrary findings the Army Corps studies which the Garrett Group Report itself had adverted Further given the reliance the TRC Report the opinion Zajac see Majority Opinion ante quoting TRC Report quotation the Zajac opinion the Roberge Reports can properly regarded implicitly rejecting the views the TRC Report well Although the majority suggests that CTDEP should have granted Islander East application based the reports such that the Garrett Group the very antithesis deferential review conclude that agency was required credit report that cites evidence contradicting the report own fourth report advanced the majority one the opposite opinions supposedly ignored CTDEP the Pellegrino Report The majority suggestion that this report was ignored CTDEP peculiar given that the report annexed the Decision Appendix Further the majority reliance the Pellegrino Report basis for the conclusion that the CTDEP Decision arbitrary and capricious puzzling The conclusion this report stated that structure benthic communities usually controlled infrequent severe events disturbances that disrupt the community and return the successional process earlier stage and that the recovery process communities characterized succession community types usually beginning with the appearance opportunistic species polychaete worms and eventually progressing the establishment high order successional assemblages such bivalves and gastropods Pellegrino Report emphasis added but the Pellegrino Report contained discussion whatsoever the impact such communities pipeline construction process that surely not the usual type disturbance Indeed the stated purpose the Pellegrino Report was simply describe the results benthic survey along the proposed Islander East pipeline route order document existing benthic community structure and provide benthic baseline against which future changes may detected sum can not agree with the majority view that the CTDEP fail acknowledge the existence the above studies Majority Opinion ante think appropriate conducting review that deferential infer that CTDEP must have acknowledged the study attached its Decision and relying the Roberge Reports implicitly acknowledged the existence studies that were explicitly mentioned and disputed the Roberge note that the majority also relies many statements the Final Environmental Impact Statement FEIS Islander East proposed pipeline issued the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC see Majority Opinion ante The FEIS however also included many findings not mentioned the majority that are consistent with CTDEP conclusion that the Islander East pipeline would adversely impact benthic communities For example the FEIS indicates that construction the trench and installation the pipeline would directly impact acres Sound bottom including acres disturbed trenching acres the creation exit hole needed for horizontal directional drilling acres disturbed cable sweep and acres anchor strikes See FEIS Islander East expected make more than anchor strikes each causing hole the Sound floor see lobsters the direct area anchor placement would suffer mortality and persistence these depressions would represent conversion benthic habitat emphasis added the weight the anchor and the depth the anchor scar the impact shellfish likely would complete mortality within the footprint the scar emphasis added The record shows that CTDEP had considered the FEIS See Decision Appendix Staff have reviewed FERC Final Environmental Impact Statement FEIS dated August majority repeatedly faults the CTDEP Decision for not point ing evidence support its rationale that the shellfish industry would negatively impacted Majority Opinion ante emphasis added see also Decision fails point even one specific lease that would impacted and states that reviewing court should not attempt itself make for such deficiencies quoting State Farm However can seen from the more complete State Farm passage quoted above Part this dissent the Supreme Court reference such deficiencies did not include failure point evidence Majority Opinion ante rather that passage referred agency reliance factors unintended Congress entire failure consider important aspect the problem proffering explanations implausible that they could not ascribed difference view the product agency expertise State Farm disagree with the majority view that the record evidence indicates with certainty that direct pipeline installation and accompanying sediment deposition would not have permanent effect the benthic environment Majority Opinion ante emphasis added The majority cites the FEIS and the four opposite opinions that contends CTDEP failed consider But not only does the record indicate discussed above that these sources were considered CTDEP the record also reveals that the reports themselves not match the majority certainty For example the TRC Report states that the anticipated degree sediment deposition should have little impact sea floor habitats and communities and may approach levels sediment resuspension and deposition the area but only the predictions are correct TRC Report emphases added internal quotation marks omitted The FEIS states that recovery most the disturbed benthic communities along the pipeline route could expected occur within years FEIS emphasis added but that some portions shellfish habitat may remain unproductive for many years due trenching activities emphasis added And while the Garrett Group Report states one point that the bottom will recover after several years Garrett Group Report emphasis added this said based the Garrett Group professional experience that bottom recoveries typically require several years the absence additional activity emphasis added and that report itself acknowledges that ecolonization bottom disturbances can vary dramatically emphasis added was hardly irrational therefore for CTDEP conclude from these hedged opinions that studies exist from which one may predict known recovery time Decision emphasis added Not one the reports relied the majority was unequivocal and CTDEP own experience with the Iroquois Pipeline more than dozen years CTDEP view that the adverse impacts such project were likely permanent CTDEP stated that habitat lost the Iroquois Pipeline installation has not recovered date Decision Appendix emphasis added the majority states that the Iroquois Pipeline installation not comparable because Islander East proposes use horizontal directional drilling HDD rather than dredging order mitigate topography problems the record does not indicate that Islander East carried its burden showing that that proposal would have substantial mitigating effect The total length the proposed pipeline was miles which miles would under the waters Long Island Sound While the majority opinion might give the impression that nearly half the pipeline laid underwater would installed means HDD see Majority Opinion ante describing the proposed HDD initiat ing the pipeline installation point onshore Connecticut approximately feet inland from the shoreline and continu ing until mile post fact mile post only feet offshore The mile posts begin North Haven Connecticut miles from the point Branford which the pipeline was enter the Sound See FEIS Thus Islander East planned use HDD under water only for the nearshore feet the pipeline see Decision less than one mile and not for the remaining miles underwater installation For the the underwater section the pipeline the Thimble Islands region and beyond Islander East proposed dredge and plow was done for the Iroquois Pipeline And the needed HDD exit underwater pit that would the dirtiest part the pipeline installation must created mechanical dredging and the area into which the muds and lubricants used the HDD process would spewed see FEIS have been less than mile from the Thimble Islands and their currently waters see Decision Appendix the majority states that CTDEP fails support its claim that area acres would impacted the Islander East pipeline Majority Opinion ante and states that FEIS refers total impacted area only acres does not appear that the CTDEP Decision was intended mean that all acres would uniformly impacted The Decision states that topographic irregularities would occur over the entire Islander East corridor Decision emphasis added and plain that the pipeline construction process would not result uniform conditions the floor the Sound The FEIS for example discussed the fact that Islander East proposed make anchor strikes see FEIS each them would cause hole the Sound floor see holes that would persist and cause conversion benthic habitat any event even only Majority Opinion ante emphasis added out acres would impacted the FEIS found would find that absence anticipated impact acres out the project made the denial the requested permit arbitrary and summarize the CTDEP Decision explained that the Islander East application was being denied because construction the pipeline planned Islander routed through the waters the Thimble Islands thriving shellfishing area that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has designated significant habitat complex need likely permanently change the benthic substrate depositing layers sediment which clams and oysters which lived the original substrate could longer survive that this would have adverse effects shellfish and the shellfish industry given that although opportunistic species such polychaete worms could expected return the areas disturbed pipeline construction uncertain when the organisms currently present these areas would return ever CTDEP denial
