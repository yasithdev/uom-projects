precedent the propriety contribution limits therefore has impact the issues before this case nlike limits independent expenditures contribution limits have been accepted means prevent quid pro quo corruption Citizens United has not made direct contributions candidates and has not suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits should subject rigorous First Amendment United Fed Election citations omitted Citizens United confirmed the continued validity contribution limits noting that they most effectively address the legitimate governmental interest identified Buckley preventing actual perceived corruption quoting the standard Fed Election Right Work see also Cao Nos LEXIS holding that Citizens United applies independent campaign expenditures and has relevance contribution limits Indeed the Court reiterated that the wealth amassed corporations and business interests more effectively used obligate legislators when spent contributions rather than independent expenditures over which the candidate has less control See Citizens United the Supreme Court preserved the distinction between expenditures and contributions there basis for Appellants attempt broaden Citizens United Appellants selective and misleading quotes carefully skip over the Court clear distinction between limits expenditures and limits See Reply The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the Circuit Courts are apply the law exists unless expressly overruled See Agostini Felton precedent this Court has direct application case yet appears rest reasons rejected some other line decisions the Court Appeals should follow the case which directly controls leaving this Court the prerogative overruling its own decisions quoting Rodriguez Quijas Citizens United left Buckley intact and not for this Court stretch Citizens handing down Citizens United the Supreme Court invalidated Arizona public financing scheme under which public matching funds were triggered privately financed candidate level expenditures Bennett Arizona gives publicly financed candidates initial allotment public funds begin their campaigns Under the challenged law privately financed opposing candidate expenditures combined with independent expenditures support the privately financed candidate and opposed the publicly financed candidate exceeded the amount this initial outlay the publicly financed candidate received proportionate amount additional matching funds twice the initial amount Supreme Court determined that the provision posed markedly more significant burden than the Millionaire Amendment struck down Davis Federal Election Commission particularly because effectively punished the nonparticipating candidate for spending his own money his own campaign Bennett The Court repeated its holding that there compelling state interest leveling the playing field and concluded that Arizona proffered interest preventing corruption and its appearance did not justify the burden posed candidate expenditures his own funds binds but for reasons explain later does not control the outcome this case Bennet reaffirmed several key holdings that the lower closely drawn standard applies contribution limits that preventing corruption and its appearance compelling state interest and that public financing still valid means funding political candidacy addition this Court recently struck down the State Connecticut ban lobbyist contributions Green Party The Court found that there was insufficient evidence infer that all contributions made state lobbyists give rise appearance corruption emphasis original reasoned that outright ban was not closely drawn because limit would have effectively addressed the appearance corruption created lobbyist contributions noting that because Connecticut recent corruption scandals way implicated lobbyists limit lobbyist contributions would adequately address the state interest combating corruption and the appearance corruption the part lobbyists emphasis original Implicit the Court reasoning the determination that recent history corruption not required for limits pass constitutional Party sustained ban contributions from state contractors because they had been implicated series recent scandals While limit may address the actual and perceived corruption does not entirely eliminate because some exchange money still allowed When the appearance corruption particularly strong due recent scandals therefore ban may urge expand Citizens United Bennett and Green Party invalidate the three provisions they challenge conclude however that their arguments not comport with the express language and reasoning these Doing Business Contribution doing business limitations have three characteristics that place them outside the scope Citizens United and Green Party First they deal with contributions opposed expenditures Second they are limits opposed outright bans Third they address the appearance corruption opposed the appearance influence The doing business limitations are only indirect constraints protected speech and associational rights they are not subject strict scrutiny but rather the more lenient closely drawn standard review addition the heightened evidentiary requirement urged Appellants does not United confirms yet again that eliminating corruption the appearance thereof sufficiently important governmental interest justify the use closely drawn restrictions campaign contributions This interest exists even where there actual corruption because the perception corruption opportunities for corruption threatens the public faith democracy See Fed Election Comm Republicans Buckley fact noted Green Party while limit may sufficient address actual corruption the appearance and public perception corruption may grave merit Citizens United stated that mere influence access elected officials insufficient justify ban independent corporate expenditures improper undue influence presumably still qualifies form See Bennett discussing the interest alleviating the corrupting influence large contributions served contribution limits emphasis added quoting Buckley Republicans imits contributions are more clearly justified link political corruption than limits other kinds unlimited political spending are corruption being understood not only quid pro quo agreements but also undue influence officeholder judgment and the appearance such influence citations omitted emphasis added Republican Comm Fed Election Improper undue influences includes both traditional quid pro quo and more discreet exchanges money for favorable independent corporate campaign expenditures may influence candidate facilitate access that may not enjoy Citizens United emphasized the right speech and its independence from the candidate Direct giving the candidate the candidate campaign committee stands different footing Since neither candidate nor contributor likely announce quid pro quo the appearance corruption has always been accepted justification for campaign contribution limitations See McCormick United States holding that elected official receipt campaign contribution amounts extortion only when official asserts that his official conduct will controlled the terms the promise undertaking but noting that the implicit exchange benefit for money very real sense unavoidable long election campaigns are financed private contributions expenditures other words because the scope quid pro quo corruption can never reliably ascertained the legislature may regulate certain indicators such corruption its appearance such when donors make large contributions because they have business with the City hope business with the City are expending money behalf others who business with the such donations certainly feed the public perception quid pro quo corruption and this alone justifies limitations perhaps outright ban When those who business with the government lobby for various interests give disproportionately large contributions incumbents regardless their ideological positions wonder that the perception arises that the contributions are made with the hope expectation that the donors will receive contracts and other favors exchange for these contributions The threat quid pro quo corruption such cases common sense and far from illusory See NCRL Bartlett upholding prohibition lobbyist contributions Blount upholding SEC Rule that prohibits municipal securities brokers and dealers from engaging municipal securities business for two years after contributing more than state officials from whom they obtain business United States Harriss dismissing First Amendment challenge lobbying disclosure act the Supreme Court recently attributed the particular threat corruption posed campaign contributions the risk mixing money and politics Bennett observing that the use personal funds reduces the candidate dependence outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks abuse money politics quoting Buckley Doing business contributions mix money and politics both ends the equation making them that much more risky and questionable Contributions candidates for City office from persons with particularly direct financial interest these officials policy decisions pose heightened risk actual and apparent corruption and merit heightened government regulation Mere access influence based independent corporate speech therefore not the concern here This even though the record occasionally also speaks the presence mere influence argue that Green Party requires evidence recent scandals order justify any contribution restriction not just ban See Letter July This not what Green Party says There reason require the legislature experience the very problem fears before taking appropriate prophylactic measures See Citizens United noting the preventative nature contribution limits because the scope quid pro quo corruption can never reliably ascertained and those instances that are known are covered bribery laws quoting Buckley see also Anthony Crowell New Lobbying Laws More Sunlight More Teeth

transparency municipal government ather than waiting for New York City see its own lobbyist scandals Appellants essentially propose giving every corruptor least one chance corrupt before anything can done but this dog not entitled bite Green Party only considered whether outright contribution ban was closely drawn the interest limits Green Party set the justificatory burden somewhere between concrete showing actual quid pro quo corruption and the sort mere conjecture that the Supreme Court has deemed out bounds Shrink Missouri the district court reasoned Ognibene require evidence actual scandals for contribution limits would conflate the interest preventing actual corruption with the separate interest preventing apparent corruption other words every case apparent corruption required showing actual corruption then the former would simply subset the latter and the prevention actual corruption would the only legitimate state interest for contribution limits Green Party consistent with Supreme Court precedent rejecting this argument due the difficulty detecting actual corruption and the equal importance eliminating apparent corruption See McConnell Buckley not dispute that the generally applicable contribution limits responded actual scandals New York City the Appellant Rather they argue that these initial limits have been successful that lower limits are unnecessary This determination however matter policy better suited for the legislature which has institutional expertise the field election regulation and effectively curbed these scandals the first place See Randall have scalpel probe each possible contribution level can not determine with any degree exactitude the precise restriction necessary carry out the statute legitimate objectives practice the legislature

are particularly problematic and merit special treatment The record contains several reports and investigations including the Commission Report the Election Report the interim report study conducted students New York University Wagner Graduate School Public Service and the Committee Governmental Operations Reports the challenged laws all which attest the significant role that doing business contributions play elections and the public perception corruption For example doing business contributors were more likely give large rather than small donations and disproportionately contributed

the perception relied upon here these circumstances where people believe that many public officials are corrupt and there substantial and material evidence support that belief clearly the public may enact preventative measures address the contaminating belief that everything for sale and restore faith the integrity the political assert several rationales for why these provisions are not closely drawn First they assert that they are overbroad because they ban legitimate well corrupt acts Buckley expressly rejected similar argument because only difficult isolate suspect contributions but more importantly Congress was justified concluding that the interest safeguarding against the appearance impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent the process raising large monetary contributions eliminated also noting that laws making criminal the giving and taking bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts those with money influence governmental action see also Ward Rock Against Racism holding that regulation protected speech may narrowly tailored even not the least restrictive least intrusive means These provisions aim eliminating not only corrupt acts but the appearance corruption They are not overbroad Rather the limits are tailored apply only those who seek benefit from the City and even then only those business dealings more likely linked corruption high value business transactions and lobbyists whose sole purpose influence City outcomes also argue that these restrictions are underinclusive because they not apply all contributors with the influence and incentive engage specifically labor organizations and neighborhood associations that not have procurement contracts which qualify business dealings the Little League that wants park play its baseball games contending with soccer league that wants the same park the same time statute not however invalid under the Constitution because might have gone farther than did Buckley see also Blount Because the primary purpose underinclusiveness analysis simply ensure that the proffered state interest actually underlies the law rule struck for underinclusiveness only can not fairly said advance any genuinely substantial governmental interest internal quotations and citations omitted The fact that the City has chosen focus one aspect quid pro quo corruption rather than every conceivable instance does not render its rationale challenge the credulous Republican Party Minnesota White The limits decided upon are not unreasonable and appear based common sense They focus misconduct that flows from business dealings with the City and include labor organizations and neighborhood associations that business with the the and election cycles groups defined doing business with the City gave total about million citywide candidates while unions and PACs gave only about million sixteen percent that total LaRue Decl New York Times New Campaign Finance Rules Skip Unions June Accordingly the City Council choice definition for business dealings effectively captures the biggest contributors The provisions are not therefore underinclusive their stated additionally contend that these provisions are overinclusive because they may applied using the broader definition lobbyist Appellees concede however that the narrower definition applies Appellee This narrower definition comports with and broader than necessary address the interest eliminating actual and perceived corruption Appellants acknowledge that the public perceives lobbyists influencing attempting influence elected officials through their campaign contributions See Pines Deposition Fran Reiter Pines Deposition Viviana Vazquez Hernandez Accordingly the inclusion people and organizations engaged lobbying activities does not render these provisions further assert that these provisions are poorly tailored because they are not indexed for inflation and discriminate based viewpoint The mere failure index for inflation however does not compel finding that the provisions are not closely drawn Randall pointed the failure index for inflation only one five factors which taken together led its conclusion that certain contribution limits violated the First Amendment See also weighing the fact that the limits applied contributions political parties and included volunteers expenses But the real problem Randall was that the limits were low that candidate could not communicate meaningfully with constituents But limits challenged here apply only certain contributions and for citywide elections and they are not suspiciously low those Randall see also Green Party noting that limit per election would effectively address the problem actual corruption without wholly extinguish ing contractor actual associational rights Appellants not provide any evidence that the reduced dollar amount which can contributed prevents the running competitive campaign Furthermore Randall was concerned that such low limits would magnify the advantages incumbency the point where they put challengers significant disadvantage The doing business limits here however have the opposite effect they seek avoid stacking the deck favor incumbents whom donors with business dealings disproportionately discrimination subset content discrimination which the government impermissibly targets not the subject matter itself but rather particular views taken the subject See Rosenberger Rector Visitors Univ Make the Road Walking Turner Appellants argue that the challenged provisions discriminate based viewpoint because neighborhood community and labor organizations which are not necessarily subject the doing business limitations share significantly different viewpoint than business owners and members management Appellants have failed however offer any evidence that these organizations share single While neighborhood association may have different mission than construction business their interests may precisely aligned particular project also does not follow that all neighborhood associations are monolithic What flies Bedford Stuyvesant may not work Harlem and what works Park Avenue may not work the Bronx Champs Elysees the Grand Concourse Since Appellants not specify what these viewpoints are difficult say what being excluded But the experience New York dictates the conclusion that neighborhood community and labor organizations not share single viewpoint Nor business Non Matching and exclude contributions from individuals subject the lower doing business limits including lobbyists well contributions from any other person required included lobbyists statement registration from the matching provisions the public financing scheme does not prevent someone from making contribution but does minimize the value that contribution this respect similar limit and subject the less stringent standard review For the reasons discussed the provision closely drawn address sufficiently important governmental public financing scheme generously matches eligible contributions using tax dollars the rate The program encourages small individual contributions and consistent with Randall interest discouraging the entrenchment incumbent candidates See Randall Crowell supra noting the public financing scheme purpose encouraging grassroots fundraising and diminishing the influence special interests When participation voluntary and public money used stricter restrictions may imposed perhaps even restrictions that would normally impermissible See Davis Candidates who choose not participate and their contributors are not prevented from freely expressing their political speech and associations the legislature has merely decided not amplify their contributions with tax dollars That decision entirely permissible Buckley held that Congress may engage public financing election campaigns and may condition acceptance public funds agreement the candidate abide specified expenditure limitations see Bennett Buckley forgoing public financing the candidates here retain the unfettered right receive contributions within the limits from lobbyists persons associated with lobbyists and other individuals with business dealings with the City Davis matching provision issue here clearly distinguishable First applies contribution limits which the Supreme Court has recognized less onerous restrictions speech than campaign expenditure limits Second while the matching provisions here may burden the candidates who choose participate the public financing scheme the provision Bennett substantially burdened nonparticipating candidates effectively forcing them put money their opponent campaign coffers Third unlike the provisions challenged Bennett and Davis New York City scheme does not impose different limits different candidates Davis have never upheld the constitutionality law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates who are competing against each other Certain contributors those with direct financial stakes the elected candidate decisions are treated differently see infra Part but the way which these contributors are treated differently the same for all the use the broader definition lobbyist for nonmatching purposes does not render overinclusive Insofar the provision reaches some contributors peripheral the business dealings such lobbyist secretary spouse does only prevent circumvention and does not form substantial portion the burden speech Turner Broadcasting System quoting Ward Interim Report providing examples how contribution through spouse with the same last name one potential way circumvent donation limits while guaranteeing the contribution associated with the family name Otherwise lobbyists will continue what they are doing Indeed use the broader definition for purposes combats circumvention while use the narrower definition lobbyist for the lower contribution limits avoids infringing the speech people not actually engaged lobbying activities This distinction appropriate balancing these competing Entity Supreme Court has held that the degree scrutiny turns the nature the activity regulated not the fact that contributions are outright banned opposed just limited Beaumont Accordingly the more lenient standard review also applies the entity ban the other hand the analysis whether restriction imposes ban merely limit relevant the closely drawn analysis See Green Party recognized four justifications for the federal ban corporate contributions the interest already discussed the interest stemming from the special characteristics the corporate structure that threaten the integrity the political process permit ting them use resources amassed the economic marketplace obtain unfair advantage the political marketplace internal quotations omitted the interest protecting individuals investments the corporation from being used support political candidates these individuals might oppose and the interest preventing the evasion valid contribution limits Since the and interests adequately justify the entity ban not consider the extent which the other rationales may rationale presents sufficiently important governmental interest for the reasons already discussed and applies equally LLCs LLPs and partnerships corporations addition the organizational form LLC LLP and partnership like corporation creates the opportunity for individual donor circumvent valid contribution See Beaumont noting that National Right Work rejected the argument that the rationale for the corporate contribution ban turns the details the corporate form opposed similar organizational structures Republicans noting that contribution limits would eroded inducement circumvent them were enhanced record contains sufficient evidence from which one could infer circumvention and perceive corruption For example these entities have become more active contributors since the corporate ban LLC contributions more than doubled from the election the Election Report Most compelling the overwhelming percentage contributions from such entities for incumbent While the rise contribution activity could attributed innocent causes the grossly disproportionate support for candidates based not ideology voting record but rather their relative position power and ability return favors creates the appearance contributions also undermine the CFA goal transparency because they only have attributed the partner owner when they exceed Committee Report Transparency particular problem for LLCs because many are involved city business especially land use yet there are minimal disclosure requirements and often publicly available information about the See Election Report see

donating through LLCs the mother all loopholes which are still permitted New York State pressing question here whether the entity ban closely hold that The expansion the corporate ban include these entities does not render overinclusive because noted the legal distinctions between these entities and corporations not make them less threat corruption the reasons that justify the corporate contribution prohibition therefore the legislature permissibly determined that there room City campaigns for entity contributions While limits may minimize circumvention and the appearance corruption the City free decide that these evils must eliminated ensure the public faith the electorate the foregoing reasons AFFIRM the judgment the district court upholding the constitutionality the

corruption that may addressed with closely drawn contribution limits the extent that this conclusion one basis which the majority upholds the special contribution limits and provisions that New York City campaign finance law imposes those doing business with the City respectfully disagree with its nevertheless conclude that these provisions pass constitutional muster pursuant the Supreme Court and this Court precedents Accordingly concur the judgment expressed Part the enactment its Campaign Finance Act CFA New York City has imposed limits the amount money that may contributed single candidate for public office given calendar These generally applicable limits are each candidate running for mayor public advocate comptroller each candidate running for borough president and each candidate running for city council Loprest Decl The appellants here take issue with these generally applicable limits but rather with subsequent limits enacted and applicable only individuals defined

with valuable City contracts grants relations with the City that concern the acquisition disposition real Lobbyists are also included within the stricter contribution limits Admin Code Collective bargaining between the City and municipal labor organizations however does not constitute doing business Simpson Decl Moreover the statutory text suggests that some neighborhood and community organizations and their members are not subject the contribution limits even when these organizations engage certain activities that would otherwise qualify doing business with the Doing business contributors are strictly limited their contributions compared others they may donate only approximately one twelfth much candidate those who are deemed not doing business with the City Because the doing business contribution limits unlike the regular limits are not indexed for inflation moreover the disparity between these two sets limits only likely increase over time Compare Admin Code with

with for total contribution The doing business contributor contrast limited contribution agree with the majority that the doing business contribution limitations this case are subject scrutiny for whether they are closely drawn serve sufficiently important interest Davis FEC internal quotation marks omitted see The Supreme Court has repeatedly indicated that while expenditure limitations are

who are seen pose particularly serious threat the government interest preventing the appearance actuality quid pro quo corruption Federal law has long prohibited government contractors from making contributions any political party committee candidate for public office any person for any political purpose use while these contractors are seeking performing pursuant contract The relevant provision however has not come before the Court This Court Green Party upheld contribution ban imposed Connecticut contractors and related individuals the wake corruption scandal but invalidated ban imposed lobbyists and their families finding insufficient evidence demonstrate that all such contributions give rise appearance corruption Other courts have upheld laws limiting various ways the campaign contributions casino operators see Casino State rel Foster lobbyists see Right Life Bartlett and municipal bond traders see Blount SEC But the case law relatively sparse and case has addressed set limits precisely analogous those law issue survive First Amendment scrutiny must both serve the City anticorruption interest and closely drawn achieve this interest There reason question whether New York City doing business restrictions satisfy this test Thousands New Yorkers are severely restricted the amounts they may contribute have matched result these restrictions some virtue more than family relationship their leadership positions institutions such the Metropolitan Museum Art the Cathedral Church John the Divine See Joseph Goldstein City Blacklist Limits Giving Sun August http blacklist limits giving contrast other New Yorkers who would qualify doing business with the City under any ordinary understanding the term such those leading municipal labor unions are subject only the higher limits Furthermore New York law restricts doing business contributions campaigns for specified City offices regardless whether the particular office stake plays any role the business relationship that the trigger for the stricter Despite the magnitude the disparity between contributions permitted from the disfavored doing business contributors and the rest the polity moreover terms the amounts they may contribute there reason question whether this stark difference treatment fact necessary whether the new limits are more effective preventing actual apparent corruption than the generally applicable contribution limits that preceded them Indeed there little record evidence any quid pro quo corruption involving New York City official since the enactment the generally applicable limits over years majority relies part the objective reasonable ness the connection between money and municipal action uphold the strict limits New York City law places upon the free speech and associational rights those doing business The Supreme Court has stated however that hen the Government defends regulation speech means redress past harms prevent anticipated harms must more than simply posit the existence the disease sought cured must demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural Turner Broad Sys FCC plurality opinion citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also Republican Fed Campaign Comm FEC opinion Breyer applying Turner the campaign finance context Shrink have never accepted mere conjecture adequate carry First Amendment burden Requiring the City point evidence demonstrating its anticorruption concern moreover does not amount giving every corruptor least one chance corrupt Reports recent scandals are one form evidence that tends show corruption its appearance see Green Party but other forms evidence including inter alia testimony those familiar with the political life the community see Shrink and surveys the populace see balance however and upon close examination the record agree with the majority conclusion that the City has adequately demonstrated that its doing business contribution limits address real and not conjectural corruption concern First report prepared for the Campaign Finance Board CFB reported that those doing business with the City tend give larger contributions candidates albeit within the contribution limits compared those lacking such business relationships See Loprest Municipal Campaign Finance and Pay Play Analysis Doing Business Contributions New York City Pay Play Report The Report cites specific instances large donations real estate developers particular during the very period when matters which these developers had interest were pending before City authorities See Even without evidence that such contributions were made exchange for quid they could well foster the appearance corruption City politics See Buckley almost equal concern the danger actual quid pro quo arrangements the impact the appearance corruption stemming from public awareness the opportunities for abuse inherent regime large individual financial contributions Also significant the fact that New York City voters passed referendum altering the New York City Charter require disclosure and regulation contributions those doing business with the City New York LaRue Charter Revision Proposal Campaign Fin Reform The Supreme Court has instructed that such votes may properly taken evidence perception corruption that legislatures may legitimately address See Shrink Missouri the record also contains troubling indications that least some the proponents the doing business limits may have aimed curtailing the influence doing business contributors much corruption its appearance See Pines Report the New York City Charter Revision noting that donations doing business contributors minimum create the perception that such donors have the opportunity and desire exercise undue influence over elected officials The anticorruption interest pressed the City justification the new contribution limits however borne out the record And these circumstances the Supreme Court precedents regarding contribution limits require the conclusion that New York City doing business restrictions are closely drawn despite the lack perfect fit between these restrictions and the threat real perceived corruption Indeed while the Supreme Court has never had occasion address campaign finance scheme involving targeted variable limits are issue here has consistently counseled that outside narrow circumstances see Randall Sorrell deference owed legislative determinations regarding campaign contribution restrictions See McConnell Judged this precedent New York City doing business contribution limits fall within although perhaps barely within the bounds the Supreme Court contribution limits those doing business within the meaning the law are held the stricter contribution limits only while doing business and for short period thereafter strongly suggesting that the law aimed the particular danger real apparent quid pro quo arrangements rather than mere influence See McConnell noting that certain regulations are reasonably tailored with various temporal limitations designed focus the regulations the important anticorruption interests served The Supreme Court has said moreover that contribution limits opposed bans involve little direct restraint contributor political communication for they permit the symbolic expression support evidenced contribution and not otherwise infringe the contributor freedom discuss candidates and issues Buckley While seems open question whether the City could not achieve its anticorruption goals with less severe restrictions doing business contributors moreover the Supreme Court has instructed that courts have scalpel probe whether legislative body has selected the precisely optimal balance free speech and security against corruption FEC Right Work Nor will legislative determination the need for prophylactic measures where corruption the evil feared the restriction placed upon contributions made the family members work associates individuals engaged lobbying the majority properly cites record evidence circumvention See And finally while continue troubled that the limits apply even campaigns for offices which the officeholder may have direct authority with regard the particular business relationship issue this feature the doing business restrictions not unique the CFA See any event appellants have waived this argument including only their reply brief See Norton Sam Club some disagreement with the majority terms the analysis here share much common ground with the majority opinion agree that the ban contributions LLCs LLPs and partnerships must upheld pursuant FEC Beaumont which the Supreme Court declined overrule Citizens United More fundamentally agree that individual citizens not their government should determine who may speak and whose speech others will listen See The Supreme Court has recognized that eveling electoral opportunities restricting political speech means making and implementing judgments about which candidates strengths should permitted contribute the outcome election Davis The First Amendment however remised mistrust governmental power stands against attempts disfavor certain subjects viewpoints well draw distinctions among speakers Citizens United This why the concept that government may restrict the speech some elements our society order enhance the relative voice others wholly foreign the First Amendment Buckley While disagree with the majority analysis the respects noted here neither the majority opinion nor this concurrence casts doubt the paramount importance upholding the freedom individuals speak they wish about the political life the nation their communities the knowledge this fundamental agreement that respectfully concur Parts and and concur the judgment Part Jesus looked saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury also saw poor widow put two very small copper coins Truly tell you said this poor widow has put more than all the others All these people gave their gifts out their wealth but she out her poverty put all she had live join the majority opinion because properly describes and follows the current law campaign finance But all not well with this law and believe appropriate state judicial opinion why think this Crotty has performed careful analysis corruption actual and its appearance and only corruption ground for upholding the regulations issue this His the necessary analysis under Supreme Court case law The High Court has told that the First Amendment protects the right speak through the use money but that the existence this right does not prevent governments from enacting campaign finance regulations furtherance their interest limiting actual apparent corruption McConnell FEC Our cases have made clear that the prevention corruption its appearance constitutes sufficiently important interest justify political contribution limits the same time the Court has rejected the idea that governments may campaign finance regulations pursue the separate interest what has rather derisively called leveling the playing field Arizona Free Enterprise Club Freedom Club PAC Bennett That under current Supreme Court doctrine governments can not defend campaign finance regulations the ground that such regulations take into account and respond the different capacities the rich and the poor speak through money legislatures the Court has indicated have role play with respect that with this position that wish take issue agree completely with the Supreme Court that the First Amendment protects each person right express political beliefs through money Where disagree with the Court its repeated insistence that any recognition the level playing field interest elsewhere referred the antidistortion interest Citizens United FEC inconsistent with this right the contrary the antidistortion interest promotes this right two important ways First prevents some speakers from drowning out the speech others And second safeguards something fundamental First Amendment importance the ability have one protected expression indicate the intensity one political beliefs These values moreover have not gone unrecognized underlying First Amendment first benefit antidistortion measures not difficult see external factor such wealth allows some individuals communicate their political views too powerfully then persons who lack wealth may for all intents and purposes excluded from the democratic dialogue much the same way that ordinances help prevent megaphone users from drowning out all others the public square contribution limits can serve prevent the wealthiest donors from rendering all other donors irrelevant from effect silencing them For articulation this concern that without regulation the rich would able use their wealth overwhelm the voices the need look further than the Supreme Court decision Red Lion Broadcasting FCC where upholding the FCC fairness doctrine the High Court long ago explained that without the rule place station owners and few networks would have unfettered power make time available only the highest bidders and thereby broadcast only those bidders political views Red Lion Broadcasting FCC see also Just the Government may limit the use equipment potentially noisy that drowns out civilized private speech may the Government limit the use broadcast equipment The right free speech broadcaster the user sound truck any other individual does not embrace right snuff out the free speech others The same true contribution limits Without restrictions the size campaign contributions the wealthy could flood the campaign coffers their preferred political candidates rendering all other contributions negligible comparison Contribution limits like noise ordinances still allow those who have the capacity full opportunity make their speech widely heard the wealthy remain able express their views forcefully through money but such limits make sure that this done only ways that leave room for everyone else the second benefit antidistortion measures perhaps more subtle but less importance relates the ability all persons rich and poor express the intensity their feelings many circumstances the intensity speaker expression tells much about the intensity that speaker beliefs Polite applause conveys less enthusiasm than shouted Bravo Passing criticisms convey weaker disagreement than passionate harangues And course the tone judicial opinion provides some indication how bleakly judge views certain area the law But where speech takes the form monetary expenditure the link between intensity beliefs and intensity expression measured the amount contributed can too easily break down This result the unequal distribution wealth which makes the amount money individual spends behalf political cause unreliable measure the intensity and depth that individual support for the cause other words and crucially large contribution person great means may influence election enormously and yet may represent far lesser intensity desire than pittance given poor person Landell Sorrell Calabresi concurring the denial rehearing banc rev sub nom Randall Sorrell return the example the megaphone the public square the problem with its loudness not just that drowns out the voices others but also that misrepresents outside observer the relative intensity the speaker views That even the megaphone user cares little about the issue being discussed his voice gets heard above all others while the voices and intensity feelings those who care passionately about the issue and shout their beliefs the top their lungs seem small comparison The one speaker relative loudness along with the other speakers relative softness obscures the depth each speaker views thereby degrading the communicative value everyone foregoing example may seem fanciful but money not And there perhaps greater distortive influence the intensity expression than wealth differences The wider the economic disparities democratic society the more difficult becomes convey with financial donations the intensity one political beliefs People who care little will they are rich still give lot People who care lot must they are poor give only little Jesus comment about the rich donors and the poor widow says all Today the amount individual campaign contribution reflects the strength that individual preferences far less than does the size his wallet this sense all political donations rich and poor alike lose crucially important aspect their communicative value when campaign funds are unrestricted And that problem profound First Amendment small irony then that refusing recognize the existence state interest leveling the playing field interest which prior Supreme Court precedents had suggested was compelling and certainly least legitimate the Court purports safeguard the unfettered interchange ideas Bennett quoting Buckley Valeo per curiam Far from standing the way this ideal the antidistortion interest vital its fulfillment Left unregulated the distorting effects immense aggregations wealth Austin Michigan Chamber Commerce overruled Citizens United will garble the political debate trumpeting voices that would otherwise muted and muting voices that would otherwise trumpeted Profound wealth differences short make difficult for speakers express and listeners discern the true depths their feelings And because wealth inequalities are inevitable and indeed many would say are desirable their creation incentives the only way ensure truly unfettered interchange ideas interchange that where each voice heard reasonable proportion the intensity the beliefs expresses give the government some freedom mitigate the fettering impact these the Court were correct that the level playing field interest does not provide appropriate reason for regulating campaign contributions then becomes difficult see why the First Amendment does not give individuals the right pay other individuals vote for candidates elections Such practice need not raise the specter quid pro quo corruption one might still buy votes behalf one preferred candidate even one could ask nothing from the candidate return The critical problem with not corruption rather that allowing the practice would give the wealthiest individuals huge effect over political elections making even their relatively minor preferences matter immensely and the possibly intense preferences the poor matter not much all This same concern course explains why state has valid interest leveling the playing field with respect campaign contributions Yet curiously the Supreme Court seems accept the validity regulations without hesitation Brown Hartlage while refuses accept the validity the antidistortion not suggesting that expressing the intensity one views the only thing that matters campaign finance doctrine election law more Nor suggesting that the playing field must fully level This area law which many considerations come into play some which such the dangers quid pro quo corruption counsel favor state regulation while others such the dangers incumbent entrenchment counsel against What specific limitations are and are not appropriate not for say even suggest They are not the kinds things courts are suited decide but instead constitute matters which legislative judgment crucial What this turn means simply stated long the Supreme Court refuses recognize the importance the antidistortion interest and its connection the ability express the intensity one feelings the Court will ignoring variable critical constitutional importance and excluding the most important players democratically elected legislatures from their proper role regard that stake here what everyone knows stake what was recognized and expressed directly succinctly and powerfully the story the widow mite The ability express one feelings with all the intensity that one has and heard central element the right speak freely believe something that fundamental that sooner later going recognized Whether this will happen through constitutional amendment through changes Supreme Court doctrine not know But will happen Rejection flawed was the rejection the concept And just constitutional law eventually came embrace that concept too will come accept the importance the antidistortion interest the law campaign with that faith better future along with understanding the requirements our flawed present that join the majority The complaint alleges that these provisions are unconstitutional both facially and applied The opinion below considered only the facial challenges See Ognibene Parkes The district court decision predates Citizens United did not consider this third Pursuant Administrative Code these figures were increased reflect changes the Consumer Price These lower limits are not indexed for inflation See Admin Code Contracts and concessions awarded through competitive sealed bidding well emergency contracts are excluded from the calculation Admin Code Separate rules govern transactions providing affordable housing All these individuals must included the lobbyist statement registration This interpretation supported the language which defining business dealings provides that lobbyist defined engages business Appellants argue that the theory not sufficient justify contribution limits quoting from Citizens United Reliance generic favoritism influence theory odds with standard First Amendment analysis because unbounded and susceptible limiting principle internal quotations omitted But the Court made clear that was dealing with independent corporate expenditures not with limits even bans campaign contributions the source contributions Appellants twist Buckley that only applicable quid pro quo corruption But quid pro quo already covered bribery laws Instead Buckley expressly approves restrictions campaign contributions facilitate the prevention all actual and apparent flatly reject Appellants argument submitted its June letter that Justice Kagan writing dissent Bennett opines that contribution limits are ineffective preventing corruption This misciting Justice Kagan opinion She does not draw the conclusion that contribution limits are per ineffective Rather she poses hypothetical which two States are plagued corrupt political system which candidates for public office accept large campaign contributions exchange for the promise that after assuming office they will rank the donors interests ahead all others Bennett Kagan dissenting such dire circumstances contribution limits alone may insufficient and easily circumvented through bundling requiring further regulation The Court notes that under Green Party such history actual corruption would merit outright ban troublesome contributions This does not mean that contribution limits are always ineffective they may adequately address less drastic circumstances For this reason the relevant analysis requires that the remedy closely The doing business limits differ from the generally applicable limits degree not kind Appellants argue that the limits hinder candidates ability amass contributions from business interests but that the purpose the law Appellants make argument that these provisions pose unusual constraints candidates fundraising contributor associational rights Whether the contribution limits hinder the ability amass contributions from business interests not the relevant test Rather the test whether candidates have access sufficient funds run campaigns where they can effectively engage with the electorate The data indicate that the challenged provisions actually have such positive effect fundraising ability See CFB Analysis Fundraising Shows New Focus Small Contributions During available http finding that candidates for City office the elections are raising funds unprecedented rate and that small contributors are starting play greater role City campaigns Appellants also fail their attempt fit this case into Davis Federal Election Commission which rejected different expenditure limits for different candidates not donation limits for different contributors Davis Even this particular doing business limit may called novel Appellants argue the justification for reduce the appearance not Restrictions contractor contributions are not uncommon and the notion that money and governmental favors are connected far from implausible See Elec limiting contributions candidates for and members the New York City Board Estimate persons with matter pending before the Board six months before and twelve months after repealed Sess News upon abolition the Board Estimate Green Party Blount Fed Election Weinstein Under

voters reinforcing the paramountcy their opposed the source funds influence the process Whatever may said about this explanation clearly does not apply contribution limits which directly benefit the

Council could immediately pass the exact same law citing the exact same scandals which now would prior the passage the law and that law would Appellants argue that the question posed the requiring disclosure and regulation contributions those doing business with the City New York should adopted misleadingly worded because implies that such contributions were not already regulated The plain inference drawn from this question however whether such contributions should further regulated and separately disclosed not simply contribution but contribution from one who does business with the
